            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

which requires Talents and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions commenſurate to its Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, than to attempt ſuch an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking at all adventures.

            <p>From <hi>Niewſtadt,</hi> where your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was pleas'd to load me with all manner of Favours, I ſet forward to <hi>Vienna,</hi> the diſtance to which is great; the courſe of the <hi>Danube</hi> making ninety <hi>German</hi> Leagues within the ſpace of five days. It is very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to imbark on this River, where a Man may ſail a great way without ſeeming to ſtir; and may change Countries and Provinces without any apparent change of Places; in ſhort, he may there find means to perform as he Travels, whatſoever can be done by him at home.</p>

for there at preſent is to be ſeen the Majeſty of the Empire, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Rome,</hi> which can be no longer ſaid to be the Metropolis of the World, ſince the other is now become the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al place of Reſidence of the Emperors.

               <p>This City is large within its ſmall compaſs. May your Highneſs not be ſurpris'd at this manner of Expreſſion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42254:6"/>
I mean, that within the ſmall extent of Ground in which it is enclos'd upon account of its Fortifications, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Populous, extremely Rich, and very well ſupply'd with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the convenience of Humane Life: I might alſo add, that this City has little waſt Ground in it, and is not irregularly built; that the largeſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Europe</hi> have a greater quantity of waſt Ground, or are more irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar than this.</p>
               <p>The two <hi>Muſaeum</hi>'s or Repoſitories which I ſaw there, are none of its leaſt Ornaments; one of theſe was brought from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and owes its original to the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> who furniſh'd it with a vaſt number of Curioſities at an incredible Expence: The other is a Patrimony of the Imperial Family, and a Collection made (as they ſay) by four Emperors: In the former are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd fifteen hundred Paintings drawn by the moſt able Maſters of that Art; among which I have obſerved ſome of <hi>Raphael, D' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin, Titian, Caraccio,

Paul Veroneſe, Corregio, Palma, Holbein, Georgeon, Schiavone, Baſſano, Albert Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Rubens, Van Dyck, &amp;c.</hi> There are alſo engrav'd Prints of the beſt Pieces of this Ineſtimable Collection; indeed the Project was well contriv'd, and the Reputation of <hi>Tenieres,</hi> who is the Graver, wou'd have been much more conſiderable, if he had taken care to put his deſign in Execution with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſucceſs: But theſe ſorry Copies ſerve only to diſguiſe the Originals, and to disfigure the fineſt Draughts in the World; ſo that the defects of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and not the excellency of thoſe admirable Maſter-pieces are apparent. There are in the ſame Repoſitory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt three hundred ancient Statues of Marble and Braſs, beſides a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eight hundred Golden Medals, all different, and more remarkable for their Rarity, and the deſign of the Hiſtory, than for the value of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which they are made. This vaſt Collection of <hi>Greek</hi> Conſular and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Medals, and others of large and

middle-ſiz'd Copper, cou'd not be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, but by the hand of a Prince as Potent and Judicious as he that left it. I have an exact Catalogue of 'em, and your Highneſs will be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd to obſerve ſo many Rarities therein. I muſt not omit by any means one Article, of which a Perſon as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as your Highneſs, ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: It is one of the fineſt Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that has been hitherto made to give light to theſe firſt obſcure paſſages of the Hiſtory of <hi>France,</hi> and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to eſtabliſh the Antiquity of that Monarchy, of which perhaps your Highneſs is not ſo well perſwaded, as of its Strength and Riches. About fifteen years ago in digging the Earth near <hi>Tournay,</hi> a Tomb was found, or rather the Remains of a Monument. It was that of <hi>Childeric</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and Father of <hi>Clouis</hi> the Great; The Bones of an Horſe with pieces of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lay by him; and 'tis well known that in thoſe times Princes were wont to allow a place in their Burial to that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42254:8"/>
of their Horſes, on which they rode upon extraordinary Occaſions. There was nothing wanting of all that the Pagan Religion conſecrated to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Memory of deceaſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sword, the Baganet, the Maſs of Arms, and a ſmall Inſtrument to write according to the Cuſtom of that Age, with a great number of Gold Medals of the Emperors <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Zeno:</hi> But that which I take to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rarity, was a certain number of Golden Bees longer than one's Thumb, and the Ring which this Prince was wont to uſe as a Seal or Signet. This is to meet with Truth in its Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where it is inviolable, and thus the Dead themſelves afford a much better Illuſtration of their Hiſtory to the Living: But it was requiſite that this Treaſure ſhould be diſcover'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt accompliſh'd Prince, that ever cou'd Reign, I mean, the ſame Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> who then govern'd the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42254:8"/>
who was not ignorant of its Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, expreſs'd his deſire of getting it in his own Poſſeſſion: I have been told at <hi>Vienna,</hi> that the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> was very ſollicitous to obtain it for the King, and that the Emperor choſe rather to make the Preſent himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Elector had taken meaſures to ſue for it: Thus the value of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is much augmented, when it is ſo frankly made. The Keeper of the Repoſitory gave me a ſight thereof, and was deſirous to know my Sentiments concerning it. I met with no great difficulty in diſcovering the Truth, and ſoon told him, that that which he ſhew'd me, was only a Copy of the Original, which was kept in <hi>France</hi> in the Royal Repoſitory; all the Pieces of which I had formerly examin'd. The Inſcription ſeem'd to me to be well compos'd, and ends (as I take it) with theſe words; <hi>Diſcas Lector, vel ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam Majeſtatem nuſquam interire.</hi> Some time after, his Imperial Majeſty did me the honour to demand my opinion on the ſame Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42254:9"/>The other Repoſitory is ſo full and ſo rich, that it wou'd be difficult to add any thing that is new, either in reſpect to the quantity or rarity of the Commodities contain'd therein: It may be ſoon perceiv'd that it is the Store-houſe of many Emperors, and that it was not poſſible for any, but theſe Maſters of the World, who may be ſaid to be in a manner Omnipotent, to make ſo noble a Collection of the moſt precious Things of the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe; ſo that one may well affirm with reſpect to this Treaſure, what <hi>Joſephus</hi> wrote in his <hi>Jewiſh Antiquities</hi> concerning the Triumph of <hi>Titus</hi> after the Conqueſt of <hi>Judaea, viz.</hi> That even thoſe Eyes that were accuſtom'd to Miracles were dazl'd with it. It wou'd be a Treſpaſs upon your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Patience, to give a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of every one of theſe Curioſities in an endleſs Diſcourſe; and you may vouchſafe to remember, that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign is only to furniſh matter for a ſimple Conference, in which I am
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42254:9"/>
unwilling to tire the Reader with a Volume; therefore I ſhall only juſt mention that which has had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Influence upon my Imagination.</p>
               <p>Two thouſand two hundred Silver Medals of the Empreſs <hi>Sabina,</hi> with the ſame Reverſe, VENERI GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRICI, all ancient, made by able Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and very well preſerv'd, are magnificent proofs of the Riches of this <hi>Muſaeum.</hi> There is alſo a portion of the Croſs, a Thorn of the Crown, and one of the four Nails which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd our Saviour <hi>J.C.</hi> to the Croſs, which, in my opinion, deſerve the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of all Chriſtians; beſides a great number of other Relicks richly enchas'd. The Gold, Ivory, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious-Stones, dazle the Eyes even of thoſe that are accuſtom'd to behold 'em: Among theſe is to be more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially admir'd, an Emerald-Cup of the bigneſs of an ordinary Bowl or Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and the pieces that have been cut out in making it hollow, ſerve as a compleat Furniture for the Empreſs.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42254:10"/>
Whence (my Lord) can we ſuppoſe this Precious-Stone to have taken its riſe? Thoſe of this Sublunary World, are not of ſo prodigious a Thickneſs; indeed, there ſeems to be ſomewhat above the effort of Nature in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Maſs; as to its colour and quality 'tis an Emerald, but in reality, with reſpect to its extent and thickneſs 'tis a perfect Miracle. The next thing remarkable, is, a large Plate of Oriental Agate about t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o Foot in Diameter, on which is engrav'd in the Subſtance of the Stone the word XPICTOC, with a B. ſet before it, which may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing obſerv'd in the Medals of the ancient Emperors of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Here it cannot be determin'd what ought to be moſt admir'd, whether the Matter or Forms, the prodigality or the deſign of Natur. There are ſuch huge Veſſels of Rock Chryſtal, that ſo large ones of common Chryſtal are not to be found elſewhere. There is alſo a Preſs full of Pieces of wrought Amber. Of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42254:10"/>
the infinite number of Agates, I ſhall only mention the large ancient one; it is an almoſt ſquare Stone, broader than high, on which are engrav'd twelve or fifteen Figures, repreſenting the Triumph of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors over the <hi>Germans,</hi> a little after the Nativity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> It has been very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly explain'd by the Emperor's Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-keeper, and I am apt to believe that it was engrav'd by the ſame hand; the Heads of Princes only are drawn in the Original, and thoſe of Slaves appear in the Graving; perhaps ſome other Perſons may engrave it better, but it is indeed one of the beſt Pieces of Antiquity that are now extant.</p>
               <p>In another Chamber is to be ſeen the Image of <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with his Arms of Maſſive Gold laden with Diamonds: This ſtately Effigies anſwers well the Character of ſo great a Prince, who diſpers'd his Riches throughout the World, and tranſported <hi>Peru</hi> into <hi>Europe.</hi> There is kept the Buff-Coat of Mail, which <hi>Guſtavus
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42254:11"/>
Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> wore at the Battel of <hi>Lutzen,</hi> where he periſh'd with the Fortune of his Party. I know not well how to come to a Concluſion, ſince all the Pieces are ſtill repreſented freſh to my Eyes, ſo that I ſhall always retain the <hi>Idea</hi> of 'em during my whole Life, and will without doubt continue very lively, till I have communicated it to your Highneſs. Mr. <hi>Vander Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> firſt ſhew'd me theſe Repoſitories, to whoſe Cuſtody they are both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: Although I ſhou'd declare that his Merit is extraordinary, that he is a good Clergy-man, and a profound Scholar, and a moſt accompliſh'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and that he enjoys all thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualities with the Favour of his Maſter, which are things very incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible; I ſhou'd not be judg'd guilty of Flattery, ſince every one gives the ſame Character of him. His Imperial Majeſty commanded that the other ſhou'd be ſhewn to me, and I was not capable of receiving a greater Honour, nor of bringing a more agreeable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42254:11"/>
to the ſight of ſo many rare Curioſities. The Imperial Library may be reckon'd as the third Treaſure; it is full of the fineſt Books in the World, and among others there are ten or twelve thouſand Manuſcripts of all ſorts of Subjects, and in all Languages; as alſo the famous Libraries of <hi>Busbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quius</hi> and <hi>Cuſpinian,</hi> and the rare Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Fuggers</hi> of <hi>Augsburg.</hi> I ſaw certain admirable Miniatures, which ſometime belong'd to the Dukes of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.</hi> I ſaw alſo <hi>Octavius Strada</hi>'s fine Collection of Medals, with a vaſt number of the Deſigns of <hi>Raphael D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin, Albert Durer,</hi> and other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maſters of the Art of Painting.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42254:12"/>
Originals, where your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may find theſe firſt rude Draughts that I have made, in their full Luſtre and Perfection.</p>
               <p>Wou'd it not be too hard a Task (my Lord) to diſcourſe to you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Imperial Majeſty, with ſuch mean Conceptions as mine? Cou'd they form any tolerable <hi>Idea,</hi> or repreſent a Character in any wiſe ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſo great an Hero? I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Honour to be in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Preſence in his Gallery of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when he was viſiting his Treaſure of ancient Medals: There I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſee during three hours and a half, a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor converſing with his Predeceſſors, which cou'd not be obſerv'd elſewhere: There, a more diſcerning and ſublime Judgment than mine might have made a Compariſon between 'em on the very ſpot: In my opinion, the Luſtre of the deceas'd Princes did not ſeem to eclipſe that of the living Emperor, in whoſe Perſon I ſaw concenter'd all that I knew, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42254:12"/>
every thing that I had read concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others: His profound Judgment, his exemplary Piety, Juſtice and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, are conſpicuous in ſo high a degree of Perfection, that a faint <hi>Idea</hi> of 'em is only to be ſeen in the World. Your Highneſs is ſenſible that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Virtues are often incompatible, and that that Soul which is ſo happy as to poſſeſs 'em all, does not always find an equal ſupply for all, during its Intercourſe with the Body, from whence it cannot paſs. Thus we rarely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Magnanimity and Fortitude, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd with that Gentleneſs and Moderation, which are requiſite for the compleat Formation of Piety and Clemency in the Heart of a Prince: But in his Imperial Majeſty, all theſe Heroick Qualities which are ſo much admir'd, proceed from a more noble Principle, that enforces Nature, and adminiſters Relief to the Weakneſſes of the Body. This is that Divine Character which Heaven imprints on the Minds of all thoſe of this Auguſt Family: This
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42254:13"/>
is that ſecond Soul which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have attributed to Hero's, which is the cauſe that he who is at preſent advanc'd to the higheſt degree of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity on Earth, is at the ſame time a potent Emperor, a virtuous Prince, an accompliſh'd Politician, and a good Chriſtian, and hath all ſociable Virtues united in his Perſon in a perfect Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which will conſtitute the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Empire, as ſoon as it ſhall be in a condition to anſwer thereto, and ſhall have merited of Heaven ſo many Bleſſings, which it may receive from his Hands, and under the Government of ſo excellent a Sovereign, and ſo prudent an Emperor.</p>
               <p>It is true (my Lord) that he is even ador'd by his own Subjects, for indeed the Reſpect and Affection that they bear to his Perſon is altogether bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. The Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> is very Magnificent and Splendid, but that which in my opinion adds to its Luſtre, is, that the Prince is every where imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, that is to ſay, in his Piety, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42254:13"/>
Courteouſneſs and Affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I know not by what means his Imperial Majeſty is more eſpecially become a publick Bleſſing to ſo many Illuſtrious Lords that depend on him, whether by the Riches or Preferments he beſtows on 'em, or by the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Example he ſhews 'em. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall give an account to your Highneſs of ſome of their Perſons and Qualities, ſuch as moſt readily occur to my Memory. The Prince of <hi>Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowitz,</hi> who is Comptroller of the Houſhold, <hi>Der Oberſte Hoffmeiſter,</hi> has the firſt Station in the Court; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being High Chancellor of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> was created a Prince by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. <hi>A.D.</hi> 1626, but he cou'd not enjoy the Privileges of this Dignity in the Diet of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and his Son was admitted thereto, by the Intereſt he had with the Emperor, and by the Exigency of Affairs.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>John Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> is High Chamberlain, and the principal Confident of his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42254:14"/>
He has a ſhare in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of all Publick Affairs, and he is acknowledg'd by the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People to be a Perſon that perfectly anſwers ſo great a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; for he is endu'd with a ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment, and a vigorous Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, join'd with Learning and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: Indeed his Embaſſies in <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the Aſſembly of <hi>Munſter,</hi> have made him known throughout the whole Continent of <hi>Europe:</hi> In ſhort, he is belov'd and eſteem'd by the Emperor even to the higheſt degree, and all Men are ſo well perſwaded of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that none envies him the happineſs of his Station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry William</hi> Count of <hi>Staremberg</hi> is the Great Marſhal; your Highneſs is ſenſible of the extraordinary Power that belongs to this Office, in all the Courts of <hi>Germany:</hi> He has an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority over the <hi>Jews,</hi> and it may not be improper here to relate ſome particular Circumſtances concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſort of People: There are in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42254:14"/>
                  <hi>Vienna</hi> about three thouſand of 'em, lodg'd in very convenient Appartments in a Burgh that bears their Name, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant about two or three hundred Paces from the City, which they may enter whenever they think fit, except on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays</hi> and <hi>Sundays,</hi> being prohibited on thoſe days by virtue of their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Chriſtian Religion; but if they ſhou'd act otherwiſe than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Order, they wou'd run the hazard of being cut in pieces. <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> propounds whether it be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a Prince to tolerate 'em in his Dominions, and produces the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and negative Arguments, but I ſhall not at preſent engage in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. They have three Synagogues in <hi>Vienna,</hi> though at <hi>Francfurt</hi> they are allow'd but one, and are there more numerous. I was told one day a Story in the ſame place which ſeem'd to me very pleaſant: A certain <hi>German</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in <hi>Latin</hi> with a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and preſs'd him to acknowledge the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> citing ſome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42254:15"/>
Paſſages which he ſhew'd in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in the Prophecies and other Places of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> inſomuch that the Doctor, who cou'd not find ſufficient Proofs to maintain his Argument, told him at laſt; Will not you grant, that our Religion was given us by the true God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, and that he made a Covenant with us? The <hi>German</hi> readily acknowledg'd it; then reply'd the <hi>Jew,</hi> When you can demonſtrate to me that your Religion proceeds from God, by as good Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as we prove ours, all will be well. The <hi>German</hi> upon this occaſion, was endu'd with more Zeal than Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: For (my Lord) what anſwer wou'd the <hi>Jew</hi> have made, if any Man had reply'd to him? This Religion was given you as a Preparative for the accompliſhment of the Promiſes, and this Covenant as a Type or Figure of the true one, to be afterward made by the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> Now if the Promiſes are apparently accompliſh'd, and if the <hi>Meſſias</hi> be already come, your Religion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42254:15"/>
and your Covenant or Diſpenſation are terminated. Therefore according to the Rules of an equitable Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it is not ſufficient for you to prove the Continuation of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and your Covenant, by the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement which God made with your Anceſtors; but it lies upon you to prove it by a Negative; that is to ſay, by ſhewing in the Holy Scriptures which are common to us, that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſias,</hi> who ought to conſummate all things, is not as yet come. Indeed their Misfortune is very great in regard that 'tis grounded upon the Word of God. The <hi>Jews</hi> are extremely obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their Opinions, and very Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, yet they are miſerable, and every where laden with the Publick Hatred. I have had ſome concern with 'em, but none relating either to Religion or State Affairs; and have purchas'd of 'em divers extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient Medals; they are eaſily wrought upon, becauſe Ignorant, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they are well skill d in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42254:16"/>The Counts of <hi>Dietrichſtein</hi> and <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> are alſo principal Officers in the Emperor's Court; the former is the Gentleman of the Horſe, and the other the Great Huntſman, both moſt worthy of their Maſter's Favour.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Trauthſon</hi> is one of the moſt conſiderable Lords of this Court: He is a very ingenious Perſon, and has in his Repoſitory all manner of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, <hi>viz.</hi> Books, ancient and modern Medals, Paintings, Agates, Marchaſites, <hi>Indian</hi> Rarities, and in ſhort, every thing that can be imagin'd. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little time I ſpent in viewing all the particular things contain'd in this <hi>Muſaeum,</hi> the Deſcription of 'em wou'd afford too much matter for a Letter. Here was to be ſeen that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Painting of <hi>Corregio,</hi> which was the moſt precious Spoil of the Sacking of <hi>Mantua.</hi> His moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, who well knew its beauty, thought fit to afford it a place in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and I was alſo deſirous to ſee it there. Another very remarkable Curioſity, is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42254:16"/>
a Cherry-ſtone on which are engrav'd above an hundred Portraitures, with different Ornaments of the Head, <hi>viz.</hi> Crowns, Diadems, Mitres, Cowls, Hats, Hoods, and Commodes for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of various ſorts. This is to bring Art to its heigheſt pitch of Perfection, to comprehend ſuch variety of Works within ſo ſmall a ſpace, and even in a manner to proceed as far as Nature it ſelf, which animates Atoms, and gives 'em organical Parts. I ſhall alſo make mention to your Highneſs of an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſte Cup that I ſaw there, it ſeems to be as fine as thoſe fabulous Cups with which the Gods were wont to Carowſe; and indeed, if the Fable cou'd impoſe on our Eyes as well as Mind, one wou'd be apt to believe it. This Lord has the ſtatelieſt Palace, and the moſt ſpacious Garden in all <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> which is altogether extended in length, or at leaſt very near from the very City Gates of <hi>Vienna</hi> to the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube.</hi> His Grand-Father was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of <hi>Rodolph</hi> II.; and I am of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42254:17"/>
opinion, that the Curioſity of this great Emperor excited that of his Confident.</p>
               <p>If your Highneſs requir'd an Account of the other illuſtrious and ingenious Perſons of <hi>Vienna,</hi> you wou'd engage me to make mention of too many, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I know all: But I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Monſieur <hi>Schrimpf,</hi> who is Reſident to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and many other Princes and States of the Empire. <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> might be endu'd with as much Virtue, and as generous a Diſpoſition as he, but (according to my Judgment) not with more. His Liberality was ſo great as to offer me whatſoever Rarity I cou'd find in his Houſe, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd me to take a Reſolution to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend nothing any longer in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; nevertheleſs I did not refuſe all the Preſents which he thought fit to make me, and I hope e're long to ſhew ſome of 'em to your Highneſs.</p>
               <p>In the mean while I muſt entertain you with two or three Divertiſements, which I ſaw taken by his Imperial
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42254:17"/>
Majeſty, who delights very much in Hunting, and ſometimes by that means recreates his Spirits, wearied with the Fatigues that are inſeparable from the Management of the Publick Affairs of the Empire. I had a ſight of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in a Foreſt about three Leagues from <hi>Vienna</hi> to the North, where his Grand Huntſman had caus'd a Tent to be prepar'd for him, under which he was with the Empreſs and thoſe Courtiers whom he had ſent for thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I was there in the Retinue of the Marqueſs of <hi>Baden Durlach,</hi> a Prince whom you know (my Lord) to be Learned, Judicious, and as well vers'd in Civil as Military Affairs. The Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtarted a great number of Stags and Hinds, which were conſtrain'd to run round the Tent by reaſon of the Gins that were laid on all ſides. The Empreſs firſt fir'd at 'em with a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſs, and the Emperor ſhot nine or ten ſeveral times within the ſpace of an Hour. About five or ſix days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their Imperial Majeſties had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42254:18"/>
Twenty three ſhot at <hi>Prater,</hi> which is the uſual Walking-place of the Emperor and the Gentry of <hi>Vienna:</hi> It is a Foreſt of high Trees ſituated along the ſides of the <hi>Danube,</hi> conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpaces being left for all ſorts of Walks; indeed this Place is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, where,
<q>
                     <l>Ogni di infonti o in boſchi</l>
                     <l>Scherzar ſi vedon' colle belle i vaghi.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaw one day three Tents, which the Emperor had order'd to be fixt for the above-mention'd Hunting; they were thoſe that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had preſented to him by his laſt Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and which were valu'd at ſixty thouſand Crowns. His Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in like manner takes much delight in reſiding at <hi>Laxemburg,</hi> which is a ſmall Palace ſituated in a Champion Country at the diſtance of three Hours Journey from <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he paſſes every Year four or five Weeks in the Seaſon of Heron-Fowling.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42254:18"/>The Emperor alſo very much diverts himſelf with Muſick, and is perfectly well skill'd in the Science, as I have been told. He maintains in his Court a great number of Muſicians, the moſt part of whom are <hi>Italians,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are either <hi>Germans</hi> or <hi>Spaniards:</hi> The former have by much the cleareſt Voices, but the later, are not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to purchaſe that advantage at ſo dear a rate, and I have obſerv d that the Succeſſors of the ancient <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> are only of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, and willing to unman themſelves ſo far as to become Muſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and to give away part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to divert others; neither do we hear that in the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are gelt for that purpoſe, as in <hi>Turkey</hi> and in <hi>Italy.</hi> I ſaw the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Andromeda</hi> acted with Machines, which his Imperial Majeſty caus'd to be repreſented in <hi>Italian</hi> to celebrate the Birth-day of the Empreſs. Some days after, a very magnificent Ball was made by his order in the entrance of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42254:19"/>
the Palace, where one hundred and fifty Players on Violins gave atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, who were all dreſs'd in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of <hi>Comaedians,</hi> and contributed much to the Divertiſement.</p>
               <p>The Empreſs takes very great delight in ſuch kinds of Sports, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they reſemble thoſe of <hi>Spain:</hi> She is honour'd in all thoſe Countries as much as the Emperor himſelf, which is done both by Reflection, and out of a due Conſideration of her particular Endowments. The higheſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is likewiſe paid to the Empreſs Dowager, who uſually reſides in the <hi>Favourites,</hi> which is a pleaſant Seat about a quarter of an Hours Journey from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and has nothing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with reſpect to the Regularity of its Architecture, but is convenient and ſpacious, its Gardens being every where adorn'd with Fountains and Statues. This Princeſs does not often appear at Court, though ſhe is always moſt honourably entertain'd there; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does ſhe almoſt at all intermeddle
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42254:19"/>
with any Affairs of State: She delights in Painting, and diverts her ſelf with that Art. I have ſeen the Picture of a Virgin drawn by her hand, which is kept in one of the Emperor's Treaſuries: But her chief Employment is the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her two Princeſſes; who are both very beautiful, and have well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd Bodies; <hi>Facies habent dignas Imperio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the diſtance of two Hours Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Vienna,</hi> is to be ſeen a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which was formerly a great The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of War, where <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperor encamp'd when he beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Vienna.</hi> God preſerve <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and more eſpecially this Country from ſuch furious Attacks: The very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of paſt Hiſtories, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make thoſe tremble that have the leaſt concern in the preſent. On the Top of the Steeple of the great Church is fixt a Star in the middle of a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, which are the Arms of old <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> as your Highneſs may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the ancient Medals of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42254:20"/>
Time. It was ſet up in Memory of this famous Siege, and to excite the People inceſſantly to pray to God to divert this Scourge, that ſo often threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens their Deſtruction. For indeed (my Lord) the <hi>Great Turk</hi> is a bad Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whoſe Power and Impiety render him equally formidable to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This Garden has chang'd its form, and is at preſent only a Place of Divertiſements. His Imperial Majeſty cauſes wild Beaſts, and extraordinary Animals to be bred and nouriſh'd there, among theſe are Lions, Lioneſſes, and young Lion-whelps, that are engender'd in this place, and ſufficiently prove the Heat and Fruitfulneſs of the Climate. I was about to buy two young Eagles on the <hi>Graben,</hi> which is the fineſt Market-place of the City, and was heretofore the Ditch, and deſign'd to preſent 'em to your Highneſs, but the want of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Carriage depriv'd me of this Honour: They were taken out of their Neſts in the Rocks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> where they are often found, being very
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42254:20"/>
common in <hi>Germany.</hi> Theſe ſorts of Birds have been always admitted into the Coat Armour of the Empire, as the moſt illuſtrious Symbol of ſtrength; and that which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> added a new, was only to ſhew the Dominion which he had eſtabliſh'd in the Eaſt, and that he had united it to that of the Weſt.</p>
               <p>Will your Highneſs ſuffer me to make a diverſion with reference to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or rather are you willing that it ſhou'd be continu'd? For this Letter ſeems to me to have no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Subject, nor any matter peculiar to it. I have been often told that the <hi>Labarum</hi> was an invention of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans, who were wont to make uſe thereof in their Armies; as the Pagans of Sooth-ſayings and Divinations to re-animate the courage of the Soldiers, and to elevate their drooping Spirits, and that the Monks enhanc'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this Story: Do not give credit to ſuch Reports, (my Lord) for the Chriſtian. Religion which is truth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42254:21"/>
it ſelf, does not ſtand in need of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to maintain it. I have in my poſſeſſion the ancient Medal of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, on the Reverſe of which a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Crowns the Emperor, who holds a Standard or Military Enſign, on which the Word <hi>Chriſt</hi> is abbreviated, and round about are read theſe words, IN HOC SIGNO VICTOR ERIS.</p>

ſaying given out long ago, <hi>Mirabilis Deus in Aquis Hungariae</hi> i. e. <hi>The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of the Divine Omnipotence are apparent in the Waters of Hungary.</hi> And indeed, there are various kinds of all ſorts of taſt's and qualities; but a Scoffer might reply, except thoſe that are good to drink; for it is certain that all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Hungary</hi> are ſomewhat Mineral, neither are they commonly drunk. A vaſt quantity of Fowl, Lobſters and Torteſſes are frequently Tranſported from thoſe Countries to <hi>Vienna.</hi> Your Highneſs cannot be ignorant of what has been wrote concerning the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fertility and verdeur of the Lake <hi>Zerniczee,</hi> where a man may every year Sow, Reap, Hunt and Fiſh. If the ſoil were every where ſo luxuriant, the Country (in my Opinion) wou'd be three quartets larger than it is. Your Highneſs likewiſe knows what is reported with reſpect to the Mines, which are ſuppos'd to be the richeſt in the World. Indeed I have ſeen in the Imperial Treaſury di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pieces of Bullion of above fifty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42254:22"/>
pounds weight, that had been taken thence, and were almoſt pure Silver The Inhabitants find very rich Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, and ſometimes even pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at the foot of their Vines; which gave occaſion to ſome Perſons to affirm that Silver-Grapes grow there, which is a fable as well as the Golden Tooth of the <hi>Sileſian</hi> Infant. The conſideration of this abundance of Wealth, makes me reſent the great loſs that Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has ſuſtain'd of a conſiderable part of this fine Country. Every thing go's to wrack with the <hi>Turks;</hi> even what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to to the Art of.

their paſt Conqueſts, by thoſe of the Neighbouring Provinces; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Divine Providence will never ſuffer it, the Piety and Power of the Princes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Zeal and bravery of their People induce me to believe ſo; beſides nature it ſelf ſeems to have ſet bounds on that ſide, to the aſpiring ambition of thoſe Enemies of Chriſtianity. The River <hi>Danube</hi> do's not tranſport the hundredth part of the Commodities to this Country that it conveys into <hi>Germany;</hi> for its Streams are too rapid in many places, and in others too ſhallow; the Rocks are alſo very numerous, and are often the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Ship-wracks. Laſtly, (my Lord) the Inhabitants are not able to mount their Cannon, and this is without doubt one of the moſt conſiderable inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that hinders 'em from carrying their Arms toward the Weſt. His Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty is alone a very potent Prince, but if the Forces of the reſt of the Empire were joyn'd to his, he wou'd have no longer cauſe to fear any thing.

               <p>I met with a very rare Curioſity: Your Highneſs is ſenſible that this City was formerly one of the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in <hi>Germany,</hi> that 'tis ſituated in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and that 'tis under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of its own Lord, who is always the Biſhop of that Dioceſs: It was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally or rather by misfortune burnt, about five Years ago, inſomuch that ſcarce one fourth part of it remain'd entire, but at preſent it begins to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its former Grandeur: It is water'd by the <hi>Danube,</hi> that receives two other Rivers, one of which runs from <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> and is as large even as the <hi>Danube</hi> it ſelf; but the other flows from the North being much leſs, and this laſt is the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of which I wou'd mention ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in particular to your Highneſs: I was much ſurpriz'd at the ſight of its colour; for 'tis almoſt as black as Ink,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42254:25"/>
and is intermixt with other Waters without loſing its quality. I have been told that the Inhabitants often Fiſh therein for Pearls, which are very large and round, but not of ſo bright a luſtre as the Oriental; yet ſome of 'em have been ſold for 200 Francs. (15<abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> Sterl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.) The Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to whom this Fiſhery belongs, takes great care of it, as I have been alſo inform'd. As for theſe kinds of black Waters, they are very common in <hi>Germany,</hi> and I have even taſted ſome that have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable ſmell and ſavour occaſion'd by Sulphur and other Minerals, with which they are impregnated.</p>
               <p>It is alſo requiſite to give your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſome account of what has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by me with reſpect to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Germans.</hi> I take 'em to be as Devout as any other People, and tho' their Religion be different, yet the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of a vertuous Life and Converſation and the hopes of attaining to a future happy ſtate, are equal in both Parties: Your Highneſs wou'd be tranſported
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42254:26"/>
with admiration in obſerving the Zeal of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> in every thing relating to the Divine ſervice; the Churches are always full; Solemn Proceſſions are made almoſt every day; and Sermons are frequently preach'd among 'em: They alſo take care to educate their Children in this Love of Holy Duties, ſo that it may be affirm'd that they are devout both by Cuſtom and Inclination, and this is the greateſt obligation they have to their Prince: Their Piety has been no leſs Conſpicious abroad than at home, and the very Stones themſelves ſeem to declare the ſame thing in the ſtreets of <hi>Vienna;</hi> that is to ſay, the Churches, Monaſteries and Hoſpitals which have been founded by 'em. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> do not enjoy the publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion in this City, but in <hi>Straſburg, Francfurt, Ratisbone, Augsburg, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm, Stugart,</hi> and other places where it is predominant, they appear very intent and exact in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions: They obſerve the Sabbath with a great deal of Circumſpection,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42254:26"/>
and Religiouſly meet in their Churches at the times appointed for Prayer and the Expoſition of the word of God: They that follow <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Reformation, are more averſe to Ceremonies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench as many of 'em as they can. I have known ſome among theſe People that were of an upright Heart, and of moſt ſound Principles: But thus much may be ſufficient for a Phyſitian to talk of Divinity.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt, the diſtinction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions is here no impediment to Trade and Commerce, neither does it produce any heats or animoſities among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who do not intermix any thing of this difference in their ordinary Affairs; which brings to my remembrance the Hiſtory of thoſe Countries of <hi>Barbary,</hi> where the Negro's live promiſcuouſly with the White People; who are ſo far accuſtom'd to this diverſity of Colour, that they do not ſo much as take the leaſt notice of it. But the <hi>Germans</hi> are more cautious in matters relating to the publick Intereſt; for in that point every
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42254:27"/>
one is mindful of his Party, adhereing to one and abandoning another without exception. However it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd (my Lord) that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sects have driven <hi>Germany</hi> as near its ruin, as its Vigour and ſtrong Conſtitution have ſupported and ſtill continue to ſupport it; neither is the Diſeaſe as yet cur'd, tho' it appears leſs malignant, becauſe the State is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd thereto, and by reaſon that the Tranquillity which it enjoys, renders it uncapable of making an experiment it ſelf. May Heaven continue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it both for its own ſafety and the advantage of the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among all the Countries in which I have Travell'd, I never ſaw any, where there is leſs talk of theſe Diviſions than at <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſo quiet a temper is to be obſerv'd there, as if all Men believ'd the ſeven Sacraments and the Maſs: Not that there is any prohibition to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about matters of Religion as in <hi>Turky;</hi> it proceeds from their love of Peace and Tranquillity, all Perſons find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42254:27"/>
it to be their Intereſt to be ſilent; and perhaps the Emperor himſelf may find means to augment his Authority, by maintaining the Privileges of each Party, and by diſcountenancing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality. The domeſtick Broils of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families may tend to the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the State, whereas a profound ſilence as to theſe Matters preſerves its Union, and makes its ſettlement more durable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> take much delight in good chear, as 'tis generally reported and believ'd; their Voluptuouſneſs in this kind conſiſts rather in the divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Feaſt, then the rarity and magnificence of the Proviſions: In theſe Entertainments they chiefly ſeek for Mirth, and thoſe charming tranſports to which they are excited by Wine: There for a while they inſenſibly loſe that dulneſs, which is as it were natural to 'em, and their Wits being refin'd by the ſubtil and hot Vapours, introduce various ſorts of Humours, which dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole continuance of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42254:28"/>
afford as many Paſtimes that are uſually terminated in fervent Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, extraordinary flights and Paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate expreſſions of Friendſhip: Others grow furious when an Inflammation ſucceeds the Heat, and hence ariſe the <hi>German</hi> Quarrels. But I wou'd be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here to ſpeak only of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſort of People, that are born and animated with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and by no means of thoſe gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, who are the pure Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of Heaven, from whence they derive their Original, much rather than from the groſs Earth. Durſt I preſume to cite your Highneſs as a Witneſs to this Truth? Can it be declar'd to what Nation you belong, ſince you have the defects of none? Or rather, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may your Highneſs not be ſaid to be a Member, in regard that you are endow'd with all the good qualities and all the advantages that are natural to every particular one?</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, the Entertainments of the Table among the <hi>Germans,</hi> are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42254:28"/>
not confin'd as every where elſe, to a certain Place, and to certain Oppertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, but they are us'd upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they always begin and end with 'em; and it may be avouch'd that in the whole courſe of their Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, they are the firſt Matter, of which the reſt of their Actions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs is the Form. I know not how to deſiſt, (my Lord) this faculty of the Mouth is the vitious part of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination. But what Nation is there in the World that is free from all manner of Faults? A <hi>German</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador made a ſmart Repartee to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>French</hi> Man, who let looſe the reins of his Ralilery ſomewhat to far; <hi>It is true</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the</hi> Germans <hi>are only Fools in there Cups, but the</hi> French <hi>are always ſo:</hi> It muſt alſo be granted that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved diſpoſition has leſs Advantage than all others: For it ſhortens Life, over-loads the Stomach and Waſte, makes Giants in breadth and thickneſs, and finally its moſt malignant Quality is, that it can ſcarce be judg'd whether
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42254:29"/>
it be a ſort of Folly that has its lucid Intervals; or whether it be a kind of Diſcretion, ſubject to Weakneſſes and Periodical tranſports, or to ſpeak more politely to your Highneſs, whether it be an intermitting Folly or Prudence. However, it does not otherwiſe corrupt the manners of the <hi>Germans;</hi> for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they are the beſt natur'd People in the World, provided ſome of 'em be excepted that are not ſo: They are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with Probity, Generoſity, Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs and a temper entirely addicted to Equity. Theſe excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are as it were natural to 'em, and to be found even among thoſe that have no advantage of Education: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this is the Reaſon why they are belov'd of all Nations, altho they do not take any conſiderable Meaſures to Court 'em at home, and they have no regard to 'em, but proportionably as they conform themſelves to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living. They have a greater ſtock of Diſcretion than of quickneſs of apprehenſion, and more Judgment
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42254:29"/>
than Politeneſs of Wit: Their Gravity tho' ſomewhat Terreſtrial is of Singular uſe to 'em as well in the management of important Negociations as in their ordinary Commerce: It alſo diſpoſes 'em to make great progreſs in the ſtudy of all manner of Humane Literature; inſomuch that there are many profound Scholars among 'em, and none that has not ſome tincture of Learning. The ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Language is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpoken by 'em as their Vulgar Tongue; 'tis true indeed, that as <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Livius</hi> was cenſur'd for his <hi>Paduan</hi> Dialect, ſo it may be objected by the way, to the <hi>Germans,</hi> that their <hi>Latin</hi> has a ſmall Reliſh of the High <hi>Dutch.</hi> Their Polity is none of the moſt refin'd as being ſuch as is not proper for the conſtituting of Hero's and Conquerors; but 'tis ſolid and conſtant, and able to procure the tranquillity of the State, and the Felicity of the People. The diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Juſtice in this Country has no circular motion, nor all thoſe Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Explications, that ſerve to eternize
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42254:30"/>
the bad Fortune of the miſerable. The Judges there are Men and not Demi-Gods as among us.</p>
               <p>The Art of Phyſick is practis'd in thoſe Parts quite otherwiſe than at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and if you except a ſmall number of its Profeſſors, the latter are more Learned, and the others talk of nothing but extraordinary Secrets and Miracles. One Grain of their black, yellow or white Powder is ſufficient (as they ſay) to cure all ſorts of Diſeaſes, but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent does not anſwer their Promiſe. They that have ſtudy'd moſt have not the greateſt employment in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try no more than elſewhere: The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a Phyſitian is there owing to a certain blind Fortune, that I know not how to explain to you, but which uſually depends upon the vogue of the common People, I mean thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing at all of the Art. A ſick Perſon is eaſily perſwaded to reſign him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the hands of an Empyrick, that promiſes him a Cure within Twenty four Hours, but he is often not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42254:30"/>
to return thanks to his Doctor. Therefore I make a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Doctor of Phyſick and a true Phyſitian.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> are not ſo magnificent as ſome other Nations, but I take 'em to be at leaſt as rational, and they ought rather to be call'd good Husbands than Niggardly Miſers. But I am ſpeaking here only of the common People, and not in the leaſt of the Princes, nor of thoſe great Perſonnages, whom the Divine Providence has ordain'd to exerciſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over others, who only ſeek for an occaſion of doing good, and (as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> has it) make no other account of Riches than to diſtribute 'em. I have even had ſometimes experience of their Generous Bounty, for his Imperial Majeſty in particular, has thought fit to honour me with a Golden Chain, which I ſhall keep during my whole Life as a mark of my good Fortune.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> count it Honourable to protect the oppreſſed, and to do all manner of Offices of kindneſs to 'em,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42254:31"/>
yet the Maxim is not general; but I ſpeak of the moſt part. Theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are alſo Wealthy, and altho' they have not ſo great ſtore of Gold as others, nevertheleſs they have in their own Country all ſorts of neceſſary Proviſions, without being beholden to Foreigners, and are much more content; is not this then to be richer? I ſhou'd not know where to conclude, if I ſhou'd continue to enumerate all their good Qualities, but they are much better known to your Highneſs than to me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am well aſſur'd that you will take 'em into farther Conſideration.</p>

            <p>IT is a ſufficient encouragement for me to ſpeak, to know that your moſt Serene Highneſs is willing to condeſcend ſo far as to hear me: 'Tis alſo ſo very honourable an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to entertain ſo Noble a Prince,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42254:32"/>
that there can be no difficulty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to ſet about the Undertaking. Any Man may eaſily imagine himſelf to be capable of affording ſome Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to your Highneſs, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one cannot but be tranſported with the greateſt Zeal to do it, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded that altho' very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Effects are only produc'd every where elſe by ordinary means, yet even Miracles might be wrought upon ſo extraordinary an Occaſion. Can this Aſſertion be eſteem'd as too pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory with reſpect to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe moſt ſagacious Judgment can ſcarce reliſh what is even admir'd by others? But I have reaſon to hope that you will not require ſuch Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of me, who am at moſt but an inquiſitive Perſon, or a lover of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; neither have I brought any thing for your Divertiſement, except ſome particular Rarities of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Tirol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curioſity</hi> (my Lord) is extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, notwithſtanding the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42254:33"/>
Sentiments of thoſe that have no Inclination to it: For it ſublimates the Mind, refines the Judgment, and enriches the Memory, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading it: Indeed 'tis attended with Pains, or rather with thoſe agreeable Diſturbances that ariſe in the ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the delight of Novelty; but of ſuch a Novelty as is wonderful, precious and ſolid, that never grows old with Time, becauſe it neither tires the Eyes nor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Thoſe noble Souls only are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being affected with <hi>Curioſity,</hi> that have a very little mixture of ordinary Matter; who make a Collection of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and diſcover the moſt ſecret Receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Nature to get Satisfaction, and for their more noble Employment; who ſeek for Truth in its very Origine, and are addicted to thoſe ſorts of Charms and Beauties, which proceed from a more skilful Hand than that of Art; who by their choice of the beſt Things that are in the World, do as it were create a new one for themſelves; who know how to unite the Mind and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42254:33"/>
Senſes in the harmonious Enjoyment of the ſame Pleaſures, and to bring 'em to a perfect Aſſociation, by giving Eyes to the Underſtanding, and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Eyes: This is the Nature of <hi>Curioſity,</hi> which is neither that Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Trifles and Things of very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moment, and ſerve only to amuſe our Minds; nor that impetuous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Luxury that ſwallows up Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: It has a greater Elevation than the former, and leſs vehemency than the other, with a Perſpicuity and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculty that belongs to neither. Upon the whole, this Paſſion is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine; which has inſpir'd the Arts and Sciences, which has adorn'd the Earth; which has open'd the Roads of the Ocean; and laſtly, which has ſo conveniently lodg'd us in this ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry World. In Republicks and Empires, <hi>Curioſity</hi> has been obſerv'd to encreaſe with Power, as if the Ambition of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes had labour'd only for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Her, as the chief Prize. Victory (my Lord) never had a greater ſhare in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42254:34"/>
Triumphs than <hi>Curioſity,</hi> which was uſually there ſet off to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as the ſweeteſt Fruit of Glory: Then the moſt renowned Perſonages, after the Fatigues of War, were wont to employ themſelves during the leiſure of Peace in the performance of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, to the undertaking of which they were excited by <hi>Curioſity.</hi> Finally, thoſe Temples, thoſe Pyramids, thoſe Amphitheatres, thoſe Columns that will never fall to ruin but with the Univerſe; thoſe Triumphal Arches conſecrated to Eternity; thoſe Aqueducts, that Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey 300 Leagues long, which makes the Road from the <hi>Alps</hi> to <hi>Calabria;</hi> thoſe Banks that force the Sea even at this day, the firmneſs and prodigious Maſs of which might appear to our ſight, as the Work of the Almighty Power, were we not otherwiſe inform'd in Hiſtory, are all the magnificent Productions of <hi>Curioſity.</hi> But if I ever had any Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for this Virtue, it ought to be more eſpecially conſpicuous in this moſt happy Conjuncture, in which ſhe has
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42254:34"/>
ſet me before your Highneſs, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd me with Matter proper for the compoſing of a Letter, to be preſented to ſo noble and ſo judicious a Perſonage.</p>
            <p>The very diverſity of Judgments and Opinions has its uſefulneſs among Men: For it animates and ſtirs up the Mind to a ſearch after Truth, and clears it from heavineſs by keeping it in action; It introduces all thoſe different manners of Living that appear ſo admirable in the World. This pleaſing Variety, which is every where conſpicuous in the Political Government, Manners and Commerce of divers People, is the moſt agreeable object of Meditation to a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or inquiſitive Perſon, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting himſelf upon the Wrack, as thoſe unfortunate Philoſophers were heretofore wont to do, admires, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates, enjoys and makes uſe of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations according to the meaſure of his own Strength and perſonal Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. How pleaſant it is! (my Lord) to ſee two reputed Wiſe-men taking different Roads to arrive at at the ſame
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42254:35"/>
Goal; ever contending for the Truth, and yet always continuing in Error; in ſhort, endeavouring during the whole courſe of their Life to get a right Underſtanding, and nevertheleſs dying without having obtain'd it. How great delight there is in obſerving that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is leſs like a Man than a Man, and that if Almighty God had not drawn the Lineaments of his Face with his own Hand, he wou'd have found means to disfigure himſelf, and to paſs into another Form; but his fantaſtical Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour cannot proceed ſo far: He may indeed put off his Humanity, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter his Shape. If I were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (my Lord) to take a flight where my Imagination leads me; might it not be affirm'd, that Man is born with a certain univerſal Diſpoſition to all the Natures of Animals; that Reaſon makes him a Man, and that by his exorbitant Paſſions he becomes a brute Beaſt of one kind or other, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination with which he is carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Thus nothing elſe is to be ſeen
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42254:35"/>
but theſe ſorts of Beaſts in Maſquerade, <hi>viz.</hi> Lions, Eagles, Tigres, Foxes, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Aſſes, Swine, and even Inſects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mask of a Man. Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who is ſo perſpicacious, cannot but take cognizance of theſe Humaniz'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, and of theſe faſhionable Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: I am apt to believe that you may ſometimes make proper Reflections on this Subject; but I return to my firſt Notions, which are to conſider how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different one ſort of People is from another, or one Nation from another.</p>
            <p>For we every where meet with new Cuſtoms, new Religions, new manners of Apparelling, Eating, Living and even Dying. Thus without expatiating too far, we may obſerve that the Sages and chief Judges among the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are cloath'd as our Buffoons, and their High-Prieſts as our Comaedians; they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to their Religion what we deteſt in ours; for Example, theſe lewd Debauches of both Sexes, which excite horror in us, are charming delights to thoſe People, and had in great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42254:36"/>
among 'em. The <hi>Indians</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to burn their dead Bodies, the <hi>Americans</hi> to devour 'em, and we to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr 'em; but the <hi>Egyptians</hi> expoſe 'em to the Air, by a kind of Superſtition that does not ceaſe to comprehend a ſubtil Notion even under its Abſurdity; for they believ'd that it was a piece of Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to bury the Corps in the boſom of the Earth, that Heaven and the other Elements had a ſhare in theſe dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and that the reſtitution of it was due, which cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d not be better done, than by depoſiting 'em in this great <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> which is common to 'em with all. Neither did they erect thoſe ſtately Pyramids, but only to ſerve 'em as Tombs. It is well known to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs how far the magnificence of theſe Works proceeded, in which are ſtill to be obſerv'd the boldneſs of Art, and the firſt Beauties of Architecture; as alſo the Myſteries of their Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>igion, and the ſecrets of their Hiſtory and Politicks; nay, they may be eſteem'd as a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Country of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as well
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42254:36"/>
as of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> How wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did this learned Nation find out Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients againſt the accidents of Death! they in a manner eterniz'd their dead Bodies, lodging 'em in Edifices of an everlaſting durableneſs, and by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rare Secret unknown to the reſt of the World, they freed 'em from that mixture of Elements, which tends to Corruption, to leave 'em only the whole pure part of their Subſtance, under a kind of firſt Matter. We ſtill ſee even at this day ſome of theſe natural Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, or precious Phantoms, in which are admir'd at the ſame time both the violent impreſſion of Time, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible force of the <hi>Mummy:</hi> One of theſe is kept at</p>

               <p>In the <hi>Muſaeum</hi> or Repoſitory of M. <hi>Weicthman,</hi> which ſeems to me ſo much the more admirable, in regard that 'tis entire, and has been preſerv'd without the uſe of any Balſam or Medicinal Compoſition. It was found the laſt age
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42254:37"/>
in the Sands of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Heat of the Sun has apparently diſpers'd all the Moiſture of this Body, which is (as your Highneſs knows very well) the next diſpoſition to Corruption, and has Communicated to it in proceſs of Time, that preſervative Heat, which reſiſts extraneous Impreſſions, which is obſervable in its drineſs, Colour and Lightneſs. I have read in <hi>Herodotus</hi> that an Army was over-whelm'd with a Mountain of Sand, which the Winds had Tranſported, and that many years after, a contrary Wind having remov'd this heap of Sand to its former Place, diſcover'd to the Inhabitants of the Country the dead Bodies of thoſe Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as entire as if they had expir'd the very ſame day. In the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory is to be ſeen a Prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of choice Rarities, more eſpecially natural Curioſities.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Schermeier</hi> ſhew'd me a great ſtock of Medals, from whence he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to extract a Collection for an entire Univerſal Hiſtory, and for want
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42254:37"/>
of the Original Coins which are not to be found for all times, he makes uſe of a Book call'd PROMPTUAIRE DES MEDAILLES, and of every thing that may contribute to the compleating of his Deſign. He alſo us'd the greater part of the Prints and Devices that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to another Book, which bears the Title of FRANCE METALLIQUE. However, I took the liberty to acquaint him, that theſe two Books were of no reputation, and that the Learned more eſpecially, the inquiſitive Antiquaries had diſ-approv'd the Fictions with which they are fill'd, ſince that which is uſeful in this matter ought always to be grounded upon Truth, and on Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Pieces. He ſeem'd to be extremely ſurpriz'd to hear ſo bad News of two Books, which were very much eſteem'd by him. However his Preparatives for this Work are curious, and contain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers very conſiderable Draughts.</p>
               <p>What is there to be declar'd to your Highneſs concerning the City of <hi>

there is nothing conceal'd from your knowledge, that relates either to its Intereſt, condition or ſtrength. I need not tell you that 'tis ſituated upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> which there begins to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate, and to aſſume that Swiftneſs, which is proper for the principal River of <hi>Europe.</hi> Eleven Baſtions that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs this Town have reſcu'd it from the Deſolation which the laſt Wars carry'd throughout the whole Continent of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> but the Honour it has had to make Alliances with your Highneſs, is in my opinion the moſt illuſtrious Pledge of its ſafety. <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Bird incurr'd the hatred of all the others, but becauſe it was protected by this Goddeſs, none durſt offer it any violence. Your Highneſs is well vers'd in the Art of making your ſelf belov'd, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may be ignorant how far the profound Reſpect that the World bears toward you may be extended: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the number of my Friends to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe even as ſoon as I declar'd my ſelf to be one of your Servants, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42254:38"/>
when upon any occaſion, I thought fit to ſhew your Picture, and the Chain of Gold, with which you were pleas'd to honour me, I was much ſurpriz'd at the extraordinary eſteem that they had for me. A great Veneration was heretofore paid in <hi>Aegypt</hi> to thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals which carry'd the Image of the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis,</hi> without having any regard to their meanneſs; I have alſo perceiv'd in many Rencounters that Honour was done to me, only upon account that the People were deſirous of doing it to your Highneſs. But theſe conſiderations ought to be referr'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Opportunity, when I may have leiſure to inſiſt on 'em more at large. From <hi>

their Liberty, which was authoriz'd in the Terms of the Confeſſion of Faith, well known to the World under the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>Auguſtan,</hi> or that of <hi>Augsburg,</hi> will alſo undoubtedly render this place famous in all Ages. The Avenues, the Fountains, the publick Places, the Town-Houſe, and all the other Edifices are magnificent: But the Emperor, who has a moſt exact knowledge of all things once told the Magiſtrates in admiring the Product of ſuch vaſt Expences, that the Inhabitants of <hi>

There can be nothing more ſtately than the Palace of the <hi>Fuggers,</hi> nor more excellent than the Paintings with which 'tis adorn'd on the outſide. It is true, that after having admir'd the Beauties of Art, a Man wou'd ſcarce meet with any thing that might anſwer his expectation in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42254:39"/>
taking a particular view of certain Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of <hi>Roman</hi> Medals, which are there found in ſome places. It is evident that they have no Originals, and that 'tis difficult to obſerve in 'em the leaſt foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of Antiquity: Upon the Sight of the word <hi>Tullius</hi> engrav'd on an ancient Piece, it has been thought a ſufficient ground to hang underneath it, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Cicero,</hi> altho' the Head in the Medal repreſents only the <hi>Genius</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> Men were not ſo inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in thoſe times, as they are now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were leſs learned.</p>

               <p>The River <hi>Inn,</hi> which waters thoſe Plains along an admirable diverſity of Landskips, affords the fineſt Object of Perſpective in the World: There I ſaw the Energy and Vivacity of Nature, as it were in the delightful Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Picture, with all the charming Embelliſhments of Miniature; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Moſes</hi> had not greater Tranſports of Joy when he diſcover'd the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> indeed there are not any Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Milk and Honey in thoſe Parts, but all the Comforts of this Life are there to be found in ſo great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that conſidering the preſent ſtate of Affairs, the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſerves ſo much Veneration, might well be eſteem'd as a Deſert in compariſon of this Country. For the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are now Maſters of <hi>Palae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> get only Milk from their Flocks, and Honey out of their Bee-hives; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ever hear it reported, that they at any time employ'd two Slaves in carrying a Cluſter of Grapes, as was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42254:42"/>
done heretofore: It ſo happens, becauſe 'tis no longer the Land of that well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved People, who liv'd amidſt Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and by reaſon that the Infidelity which is there predominant has remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd the Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Tirol</hi> have every where very fine Crops and ſpacious Vineyards. Their Wines are excellent; for their Strength and delicious Taſte, which are generally apt to be ſpoil'd in all other Places, are here moſt exquiſite, and give 'em an agreeable Tartneſs, that pleaſes and penetrates the Palate both together. Their Cattel are of an admirable Kind; and they have ſuch extraordinary Birds, that even the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do not know their ſeveral <hi>Species:</hi> Some of theſe have been ſhewn to me, that live only upon the Roſin of Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees; neither have they any other Taſte: They are call'd <hi>Artagenes,</hi> and I remember to have read their Name in <hi>Pliny.</hi> Theſe Birds are without doubt very dainty-mouth'd to live upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Extracts and Quinteſſences. The Copper-Mines are there ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42254:43"/>
that they ſupply almoſt the whole Country of <hi>Germany;</hi> but the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Noremberg</hi> make more uſe of 'em than the others, becauſe the Metal which is taken from thence is ſofter and malleable. Silver is alſo common in thoſe Parts, and Gold leſs ſcarce than elſewhere. A certain private Perſon who knew not its uſe deſir'd a Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Arch-Duke to cover part of his Houſe with it, and the Anſwer was ſuitable to ſo impertinent a Requeſt, <hi>I give you leave,</hi> (reply'd the Prince) <hi>but I will not be oblig'd to ſecure it for you from Thieves.</hi> That famous Gallery, which is cover'd with two or three thouſand Gold Tiles, is at preſent in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Poſſeſſion, and I have been told, that a certain <hi>Jew</hi> had offer'd one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Florins for every one of 'em; but a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> would have bid more, for the <hi>Jews</hi> are wont to buy Merchandiſes only after their manner. However, this Pent-houſe might ſhelter a great many People from Poverty, who cou'd eaſily purchaſe one to defend 'em from the Injuries of the Weather at a much cheaper rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:42254:43"/>All this may perhaps afford but little Satisfaction to your Highneſs, ſince an account of much finer Curioſities ought only to be preſented to you, and I am very ſenſible that you have reaſon to complain of my extravagant Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Therefore (my Lord) I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly retrench 'em to give you a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the chiefeſt Rarities and Curioſities which I obſerv'd at</p>

               <p>This City has not been ruin'd by the Wars; for the Prudence of its Princes has preſerv'd its Civil Tranquillity, and the ſituation of the Country has defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it from Foreign Aſſaults; Your Highneſs well knows it to be inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble except in two places, where four hundred Men may repulſe forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. This is that rich Plain, in which the Arch-Dukes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> have fixt the center of their Treaſures. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> caus d the Caſtle of <hi>Amras</hi> to be built at the diſtance of half a League from <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> and there (my Lord) I ſaw thoſe Rarities, a particular Account of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42254:44"/>
which will (as I preſume) be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your Highneſs. M. <hi>Roland,</hi> who is the Governour of the ſaid Caſtle, gave me entire Satisfaction in this Matter; his Merit is extraordinary, and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Deportment the moſt obliging in the World. I had Commendatory Letters from his Imperial Majeſty, which gave me admiſſion into all the Appartments, but I perceiv d in the Governour's being ſo extremely offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to me, that he was not only ready to obey the Orders, but that he had alſo a particular Reſpect for the Bearer of 'em, and that I cou'd not come off, without acknowledging that I ow'd the ſight of ſo many rare Curioſities purely to the Emperor's favour, being alſo oblig'd to him, for part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light I had taken in the viewing of 'em.</p>
               <p>After having obſerv'd the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of the Caſtle, its Situation, the order of the Buildings and the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, I enter'd and apply'd my ſelf entirely to the Enjoyment of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Treaſures. The firſt things that offer'd themſelves to my view,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42254:44"/>
were ſome of thoſe ſorts of Stones, of which the old <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to make uſe to mark the diſtances of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were counted in thoſe times by <hi>tertio aut quarto ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbe Lapide,</hi> i. e. <hi>The third or fourth Stone from the City:</hi> Some of 'em had no Inſcriptions, and thoſe that had any, were conformable to what I have read in ancient Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>From thence I paſs'd into two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries full of all ſorts of different Armour, which are now in uſe, and were ſo in former Ages: They induc'd me to make this Reflection, that Men notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they might wear Skins of Iron and Steel, or at leaſt, Cloaths made of thoſe Materials, were nevertheleſs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invulnerable nor immortal. I there ſaw the Arms of the two <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milians,</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> V. and of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperors, as alſo thoſe of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> I. King of <hi>France,</hi> with the Garment which he wore at the Battel of <hi>Pavia,</hi> which makes me call to mind, that I had already ſeen one in the Repoſitory of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> ſo that he either put on two Suits of Cloaths on that day, or they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42254:45"/>
were divided on purpoſe to ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the fame of the Victory, at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> and <hi>Inſpruck.</hi> There are alſo to be ſeen thoſe of <hi>Charles</hi> IX. King of <hi>France;</hi> of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and of many other Princes. I was told that theſe laſt were the very ſame that he wore at the famous Battel of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> But I ſpent ſome time in viewing thoſe of <hi>Alexander. Farneſe</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting what I had read in <hi>Strada</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the notable Exploits of this Prince: I know not whether any thing were wanting to his Merit; but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that his Hiſtory cannot be better writ, and that even the actions of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great are not ſet off to more advantage by Hiſtoriographers than his. I admir'd the Arms of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Great, which as yet ſtrike Terror into the Minds of Beholders, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with ſome Conſternation, that this <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor once caus'd the whole World to tremble. The Arms of the moſt part of the renowned Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42254:45"/>
of theſe later Times, are in like manner kept in the ſame Repoſitory. The Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> made this Conqueſt; cou'd any Man proceed farther (my Lord) than to diſarm ſo many Heroes? But this was only an amicable Conqueſt, this Prince who was the moſt excellent Antiquary of all that govern'd in his Age knew well what value ought to be ſet upon thoſe precious Spoils; He was deſirous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 'em every where, and was even ſometimes prevented: I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they were offer'd to him, leſt not being ſought for, they ſhou'd not have the good Fortune to be ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſecrated.</p>
               <p>At the end of one of the Galleries, I ſaw the repreſentation of a Giant and a Dwarf, the living Originals of which had ſometime reſided at <hi>Vienna.</hi> Indeed this exorbitant inequality of Stature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Men, is a very ſtrange thing; the Elder of theſe was not able to reach with his Hand to the Navel of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet a Ballad was made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Box on the Ear, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42254:46"/>
by this Dwarf to the Giant: It is true, that the later ſtoopt to take up the Emperor's Glove, who had let it fall on purpoſe to facilitate the giving of the Box o' th' Ear. Theſe ſports of Nature are ſtill much eſteem'd at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> either becauſe her Ability in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Men of quite different ſorts and ſizes is there admir'd; or her Error in ſometimes making much more, or elſe much leſs than ſhe ought. Their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſties likewiſe maintain ſome of theſe Giants and Dwarfs in their Court, whom I cou'd never behold without a kind of Horror, in regard that they are ſo far from the ordinary proportion and ſize of other Men.</p>
               <p>In a ſpacious Hall are to be ſeen all the ſeveral ſorts of Garments which the <hi>Turks</hi> are wont to wear both in their Houſes and in the Camp. There are many rich Veſts in which the price, quality, quantity and colour of the Stuff of which they are made, ſhew the natural Diſpoſition of this Nation to Luxury and Magnificence. This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of attiring ſurpaſſes all ours, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42254:46"/>
are introduc'd purely by a fantaſtical Humour, and the continual change of which denotes but too much Levity. If we cou'd be once perſwaded to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this Auguſt manner of Apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and to appear in theſe magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pieces of Drapery, perhaps we ſhou'd continue the uſe of 'em, and our Faſhion might turn to a ſettl'd Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom as among the <hi>Levantines.</hi> And indeed, theſe Infidels have got the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in this reſpect, inſomuch that one of their <hi>Viſiers,</hi> one day told the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador, that the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were apt to deride, but were not well clad: The <hi>Venetian</hi> might have reply'd elſewhere than at the Port; 'tis true, but 'tis pity to ſee ſuch Swine as you attir'd with the Ornaments of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes. I alſo obſerv'd there, Turbans of a hundred various Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and one wou'd not imagine, that they had all the ſame uſe: The fineſt of 'em have a kind of ſtately Air, and notwithſtanding whatever our nice Faſhion-mongers may affirm to the contrary, theſe Mountains of Linnen-Cloath
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42254:47"/>
that ſerve ſo well to adorn the Heads of theſe Barbarians, wou'd not diſguiſe our Hero's; for they really im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant Grandeur and Severity in the Countenance, which wou'd even ſet off Majeſty it ſelf. Afterward I took a view of divers Cimeters or Hangers of great value for the rich Ornaments with which they are cover'd, and alſo upon account of their rare Temper, ſo that Fury it ſelf might well go to work with theſe Weapons. Laſtly, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of choice Rarities of this Country are to be found Here.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Hall are two Figures that repreſent two <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lords on Horſe-back, and I obſerv'd in 'em as great an Air of Grandeur, Gravity and Statelineſs, as is poſſible for Art to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in Copies, but 'tis probable that the Originals were quite another thing. One of theſe Perſonages was <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries, and the other <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> or Baſſa of <hi>Offen</hi> or <hi>Buda.</hi> They were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoners upon different occaſions, and gave as a part of their Ranſom their moſt ſumptuous Equipage; which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42254:47"/>
is very carefully preſerv'd, and well deſerves to be ſo: For not only the Garments, but the Horſe-cloath, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and Bridles were all beſet with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, Emeralds, Grenats, Topaz-ſtones and Pearls, being ſo many profuſe Treaſures.</p>
               <p>I enter'd another Gallery full of Paintings of the beſt Maſters, although it muſt be acknowledg'd that they are not all choice ones as thoſe at <hi>Vienna.</hi> I apply'd my ſelf more particularly to the viewing of the Portraiture of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hungarian</hi> Noble-man, which is not ſo much to be admir'd for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Draught, as for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy which it repreſents, <hi>viz.</hi> a Wound made with a Lance in the Eye, which penetrated into the Subſtance of the Brain, even to the hinder part of the Head, and yet did not prove Mortal. This is a Secret of Nature, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together hid from us, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds all our Argumentations.</p>
               <p>I did not allow my ſelf time ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to examine theſe Paintings in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, becauſe I was diverted by the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42254:48"/>
variety of other things that were not ſo common. Amidſt a great quantity of Stags Horns, which are there very extraordinary, I obſerv'd one as it were mortis'd in a Trunk of Oak, ſo neatly that the Artifice cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; it was cut on purpoſe to be plac'd among the other Rarities. Upon this occaſion I remember that pair of Stags Horns which I ſaw (my Lord) amidſt ſo many others, in your Guard-Chamber at <hi>Stugart,</hi> which are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangl'd one with another, that they ſeem ſtill to expreſs the Fury of the two Animals, which wou'd never ceaſe but with their Life.</p>
               <p>The ſame Gallery ſeems to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into two by twenty Preſſes, twelve Foot high and ſix broad, where all the richeſt and choiceſt Rarities are depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited: In the firſt are contain'd divers pieces of Alabaſter and Marble, whoſe Colours and various Figures dazzle the Eyes of the Beholders: In the ſecond is a vaſt quantity of Glaſs veſſels, and every thing that can be imagin'd inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in the Art of Glaſs-work: In the third is Coral of all kinds and of all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42254:48"/>
ſorts of Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> white, red, black, grey and violet-colour'd: There are ſome pieces of it in the form of Plants, Shrubs and Branches, and others are wrought in the ſhape of a Man's Head, of a Rock, of a pair of Beads, and an infinite number of other Figures: in the fourth are found wrought Precious-ſtones both ancient and modern, the moſt part of which are Agats, Jaſpars and Cornelians: There are alſo Rocks beſet with Pearls and rich Stones; and in ſhort, the Jewels of this nature are ſo numerous, that this Preſs alone is an ineſtimable Treaſure. In the fifth are preſerv'd Urns of red Earth, and others of Porcelane of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> among which are obſerv'd ſome counterfeit; they are the common ones that come from <hi>Holland,</hi> which have been put in vogue on purpoſe to ſave a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: But do not imagine (my Lord) that they are plac'd there to make up the number, there is a quite different deſign and meaning as to this matter: For ſuper fine things ever appear more illuſtrious, when accompany'd with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42254:49"/>
ordinary ones, and the Compariſon made between 'em ſerves to enhance their Value. Thus an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> is ſometimes painted ſtanding near a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Woman, and it tends to her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for the Deformity that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at her ſide, ſerves as a foil to ſet off her Beauty with more charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Luſtre: Thus the light of a Torch that grows pale in the Sun, ſhines bright and ſparkles in the dark.</p>
               <p>In the other Preſſes are contain'd Curioſities of all ſorts, but a larger Deſcription of 'em wou'd tire your Highneſs's Patience: Therefore I ſhall leave it to ſpeak only of thoſe kinds of Matters, of which you ſeem to require a more exact Account. There is a Collection of ancient Gold Medals from <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Heraclius;</hi> being the moſt perfect of all that ever I ſaw, both with reſpect to the number of the Coins and their Beauty: It wou'd be very difficult, if not impoſſible, to find elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where any Medals that are more rare, or have been better preſerv'd. There is alſo another Collection of thoſe of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42254:49"/>
Conſuls and Emperors, and a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious quantity of Silver-Medals, but thoſe of Copper are infinitely more precious than all the others. None but a Prince ſo much addicted to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and ſo Learned, cou'd be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making ſo good a Choice, or of defraying the charge of ſo expenſive an Undertaking. When his Imperial Majeſty ſhall have joyn'd theſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Pieces to as many others that are in his Poſſeſſion at <hi>Vienna,</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that his Repoſitory, and that of the King, will be the largeſt and moſt conſiderable. Is it not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the choiceſt Rarities ſhou'd be ſhar'd between the two greateſt Princes in the World, and that thoſe venerable Monuments of Antiquity ſhou'd find ſuch ſecure Sanctuaries, againſt the injuries of Time, and the accidents of bad Fortune.</p>
               <p>It is now time to declare ſomewhat to your Highneſs concerning that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Arch-Duke, who in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to gratify his Curioſity and to divert himſelf, found means to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42254:50"/>
his Glory; neither did thoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enquiries, exhauſt his Spirits, but only afforded ſome Relaxation to his noble Soul, which was by that means better diſpos'd to the practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. His Life was as glorious as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Age in which he liv'd. The Siege of <hi>Sigeth</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which he forc'd the <hi>Turk</hi> to raiſe, is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Monument of his Valour, and the Treaſures of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, which he has re-collected and re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in their primitive Luſtre, will be ſo many Heralds to proclaim the great Obligations which he has laid upon all his Poſterity, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon the Republick of Learning. If ſo great Veneration is uſually paid to the Memory of Hiſtorians, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have tranſmitted ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Antiquity, with what tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports of Zeal ought we to expreſs our Gratitude to a Prince who has furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with the very Originals, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the Enjoyment even of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf? A <hi>Roman</hi> Senator who was advanc'd to the Imperial Dignity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42254:50"/>
it an honour to his Family, to reckon <hi>Tacitus</hi> the Hiſtorian among his Anceſtors: Who then can doubt but that the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> do ſtill call to mind with great delight, that an Arch-Duke of their Noble Stock, has been the Reſtorer of Truth, and of ſo many Rarities of which we had been almoſt entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd by Ignorance and the injury of Time? This one Conſideration of his Merit is alone ſufficient to ſupply us with Matter for a Panegyrick.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper to add a Word or two concerning the Library, ſince it ows its original to this Prince: There are not any Books contain'd therein, but ſuch as are more correct and of the beſt Editions. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a conſiderable number of 'em, that more eſpecially treat of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Curious, as alſo many that I did not know, and perhaps ſuch as are not to be met with elſewhere. The Portraiture of the greater part of thoſe Authors whoſe Learning has made 'em famous throughout the World
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42254:51"/>
ſerve as the peculiar Ornaments of this Library. This indeed, is properly to aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate the Fathers with the Children, to place the Learned amidſt their Books.</p>
               <p>I know not how to leave <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> without mentioning to your Highneſs certain brazen Figures or Statues, which I ſaw in the principal Church. They are Twenty eight in number, about nine or ten Foot high, and altho' the Materials of which every one of 'em is made, amount to the value of two or three thouſand Crowns; nevertheleſs the Workmanſhip is infinitely more precious. I there diſcover'd many Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and Arch-Dukes; and took par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of the four Dukes of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> and their Heireſs <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe Wealth and Power have render'd the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> formidable to all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> There was no need of reading the Names that are engrav'd over theſe Statues, I knew the very Air of their Countenance, which I had before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv d in ſo many Medals and Prints, and the Proportion is ſo exact, that I eaſily diſtinguiſh'd 'em, even at the firſt ſight.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42254:51"/>
Theſe Images are alſo repreſented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Braſs Cuts and illuſtrated, with an Hiſtorical Deſcription, ſo that they may well deſerve a place in a Prince's Repoſitory: If your Highneſs be of this opinion, I ſhall take it as an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be permitted to augment your Library with a Set of 'em, which I have in my Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>It is very difficult to give a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Genius</hi> or natural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Tirolians;</hi> who are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Italians</hi> nor <hi>Germans,</hi> but both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. There may be ſome variety of Matter, with which to entertain your Highneſs, concerning the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ought to be made with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe People, who equally partake of the Qualities of two very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nations that border upon 'em. For a Queſtion has been propounded long ago, whether contrary Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments are brought to Perfection, or ſpoil'd in the Mixture: Some Perſons affirm that the Quickneſs and Subtilty of <hi>Italy</hi> is meliorated by being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what allay d with the Phlegmatick
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42254:52"/>
Temper of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that this Phlegm likewiſe ſtands in need of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity to animate it: Others are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that this ſubtil Spirit beyond the Mountains, has its tincture of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, which ſerves to ſet it off, that a mixture of a groſſer ſort of Blood wou'd diminiſh its luſtre, and that the ſlowneſs of the <hi>Germans</hi> has a Solidity, which cannot be refin'd without weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it. Your Highneſs is a much more competent Judge than I, what Party 'tis requiſite to follow, but if you ſhou'd enjoin me to declare my opinion as to this matter, I wou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to permit me to do it only to your ſelf in private.</p>
               <p>To take breath again a little, will your Highneſs vouchſafe to give me leave to ſpeak a Word or two to you concerning my Hoſt at <hi>Inſpruck.</hi> Upon account of the uncertainty of my abode in this Town, which might perhaps continue for ſome days, I order'd my Servant to treat with him about my Expences, and they agreed for two Florins and a half a day, nevertheleſs

when he was ready to pay according to this Price, the Landlord wou'd not be ſatisfied, and alledg'd for an Excuſe, that the Entertainment indeed did not exceed the Price agreed upon, but that he was oblig'd to act conformably there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to only with the ordinary ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that for a Perſon of Quality as I was, the Price ought to be proportionably enhanc'd; that he was aſham'd not to have a greater regard to me than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and that he knew too well the Honour and Reſpect that was due to me, to ſtand to his firſt bargain. This was not altogether to pay for Quality, but 'twas a Device to put me upon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Reſpect at a very dear rate.</p>

               <p>So many great <hi>Idea</hi>'s of thoſe things that I ſaw there, ſtill preſent themſelves to my Mind, as may be ſufficient to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie my detaining of your Highneſs for a Moment: This City is moderately

large, well built, extremely populous and very rich. All its Outworks and Avenues lie open and waſte, and the neareſt Villages are ſituated at a great diſtance, ſo that a Man enters a Plain convenient for Hunting, even as ſoon as he has ſet a foot out of the Gates. I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to arrive there at a very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, for the whole Town was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with a pompous Solemnity ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in memory of the famous Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Prague:</hi> Your moſt Serene High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not ignorant how much this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory contributed to the good Fortune of its Prince, for it ſecur'd the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Dominions, caus'd the Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dignity to paſs into his Family, and made him Maſter of the upper <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi> all which advantages cannot but wonderfully augment his Power and Authority. The State and even private Perſons ſpar'd no coſt to honour the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival, and Joy appear'd on all ſides in the ſumptuous Apparel and Feaſtings, as alſo in the Fire-works, Illuminations, the diſcharging of Artillery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Electoral Highneſſes invited the People
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42254:53"/>
by their Example to return thanks to God for the gaining of this Battel, and thus Piety and Religion were no leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the Solemnity than Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Divertiſements.</p>
               <p>This Feſtival was follow'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appointed for the Birth-day of the Elect'reſs. The whole Court ſhone as it were with a new luſtre, there was no other talk than of Pleaſure, and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> ſeem'd to endeavour to ſurpaſs it ſelf, by the profuſe Expences that were laid out upon this occaſion, and the utmoſt extent of Gallantry. The Sumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Feaſts appear'd in the good Chear, in the Treaſures of Silver-Plate that were ſet forth; and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts of Muſick, which ſerv'd to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Delights. The Principal Ladies of the Court waited upon their Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Highneſſes, and nothing cou'd be more rich and ſplendid than their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; inſomuch that I fancy'd that I ſaw <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> attended by the Muſes and their Nymphs. The Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the acting of which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd for ſome days by reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42254:54"/>
of the Elect'reſs, was then repreſented with greater advantage: It was taken out of an <hi>Italian</hi> Hiſtory, and call'd <hi>Adelaide,</hi> in Honour of the noble Perſonage for whom it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</p>
               <p>Nothing appear'd to me more ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than the Carrouſel, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in a cover'd Manege or kind of Theatre, ſeparated from the Palace on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a ſmall Canal. The Elect'reſs was conducted to her Balcony by the Elector himſelf, and two Galleries ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated one over another, that take up the whole compaſs of the Building, were fill'd with Spectators, who were at firſt ſurpris'd by the Conſorts of Muſick that appear'd in Pageants made in the form of Ships, every one of which was drawn by ſix Horſes; when theſe Machines were brought under the Balcony of her Electoral Highneſs, the Muſicians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to play and Sing their Parts; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any need of Divination to conjecture that they were Sonnets of Praiſe, compos'd on purpoſe for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. This Delight continu'd above
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42254:54"/>
two hours, neither cou'd I perceive any one to be tir'd with it during the whole time; but it was follow'd by a greater and more magnificent Diverſion. For four ſmall Bands of Horſe, each of 'em conſiſting of four Horſe-men, rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and ſhew'd their Bravery and Dexterity, in the ſwiftneſs of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in the exactneſs of their Courſe, in the Agility of their Bodies, and in that admirable Facility, with which they were obſerv'd ſo fortunately to arrive at the Goal: His Electoral Highneſs and Prince <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Brother, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at the Head of the two firſt Bands, and it was obſerv'd, that theſe two Princes, who had won the firſt Prizes, abated ſomewhat of their ſpeed, on purpoſe to leave the Honour altogether entire to their Officers, and to give 'em the Recompence of Glory, and the whole Victory which were due to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: This manner of acting has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great Character, and really there is need of a ſuperfluity of Glory to be ſo prodigal of it. His Electoral Highneſs is endow'd with all the other
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42254:55"/>
excellent Qualities that are requiſite in an accompliſh'd Prince: It may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by his Conduct, that the Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vertues are ſet on work by Piety, Gentleneſs and Moderation, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire him with a perfect tranquillity of Mind: When there are no occaſions of carrying on a neceſſary War, he is unwilling to undertake an unjuſt one; thus he generouſly regulates his aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Thoughts, endeavouring to bound their exorbitant Motions, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the ſweet Fruits of Peace and Proſperity throughout his Dominions; If his Renown does not make ſo great a noiſe in the World, 'tis ſo much the more ſolid; thus the Stars of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament which dart ſo little light, are of a value quite different from that of blazing Comets, that cauſe ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in the ignorant Multitude. He takes much delight in Hunting and Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which puts me in mind of thoſe of that excellent Emperor <hi>Antoninus, Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando &amp; venando oblectatus est.</hi> By the means of theſe innocent Diverſions, he gets rid of all other leſs lawful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42254:55"/>
and his ſolid Delights are no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to his Health, Religion, or Secular Affairs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall always remember, even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my whole Life, with the higheſt ſenſe of Gratitude, the ſignal Favours which he has conferr'd upon me; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I declare 'em more gloriouſly than to your moſt Serene Highneſs. His Electoral Highneſs condeſcended ſo far as to ſend an Officer to my Houſe, on purpoſe to ſhew me the Place of his Reſidence; that is to ſay, the Palace which the Elector <hi>Maximilian</hi> caus'd to be built at ſo vaſt an expence, that all <hi>Germany</hi> was ſurpris'd at it, and cou'd not comprehend, whence he rais'd a ſufficient Fond for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of ſo prodigious a Work. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs this Magnificent Prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that if he cou'd be aſſur'd of living ten years longer, he wou'd have it demoliſh'd, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build another more ſtately. However, this noble Pile of Building has ſo many different Appartments, that beſides thoſe which are already poſſeſs'd, there
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42254:56"/>
wou'd be room enough in the others to entertain the Emperor, the King and the Electors, as conveniently as in their own Palaces. Your moſt Serene High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wou'd be altogether tir'd with ſo long a Diſcourſe, if I ſhou'd proceed to give a more particular Account of its Architecture; than which there can be nothing finer; but 'tis affirm'd by ſome Perſons, that there is no ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture to be found, whoſe Orders take up ſo vaſt a ſpace of Ground. There is ſo great a quantity of Marble, that one wou'd believe it to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Product of that Country, and the ordinary Stones of thoſe beyond the Mountains, becauſe they are more ſcarce in thoſe Parts. There is no Corner, Nich, Gate, nor Chimney, that has not its Statues or Ornaments in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; but all this diſappears at the ſight of the Hall of ancient Monuments: There one may reckon up 354 <hi>Busts</hi> or Statues drawn half way, of Jaſpar, Porphyry, Braſs and Marble, of all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which repreſent either <hi>Graecian</hi> Generals or <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42254:56"/>
whom either their high Birth, or notable Exploits have as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortaliz'd. Among other Statues I ſaw that of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the Life. It has all that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing deſign of Antiquity, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirits the Marble, and gives it ſo live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Air, that leſs Art is diſcern'd in it, than a kind of Magical Energy; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that one may obſerve at the ſame time, Valour, Ambition, and that charming Civility, which had ſo great a ſhare in the Conqueſts of <hi>Aſia;</hi> In ſhort, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great is much better repreſented here than in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of his Atchievements. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Statues are likewiſe admirable in their ſeveral kinds, and a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quantity of Paper than that which is ſufficient for a Letter, wou'd be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make particular Reflections on every one of theſe Curioſities. There are alſo to be ſeen a great number of Idols, and Veſſels that ſerv'd for the Sacrifices of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>There are two Galleries, one of which is adorn'd with a hundred Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures

of Illuſtrious Perſonages, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe that were famous for their extraordinary Learning, who were not unknown to me: Upon the Cieling of the other, are repreſented the principal Towns of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as alſo the Rivers, Caſtles, and whatever is moſt remarkable within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of this Electorate. I ſaw a Hall of that ſort of Work, which the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> call <hi>Stucador,</hi> where the Figures are excellent. The King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Munick,</hi> met with nothing in this Palace more beautiful than a Chimney-piece made of <hi>Stuc,</hi> with the Work-manſhip of which he was exceedingly pleas'd, to that degree that he ſeem'd to be much diſcontented that it cou'd not be made a Spoil: But when a certain Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Attendants endeavour'd to perſwade him to cauſe theſe ſtately Buildings to be demoliſh'd, he reply'd, That he had no mind to deprive the World of ſo great a Rarity. Thus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity appears every where magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and 'tis to be endu'd with the true
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42254:58"/>
principles of Generoſity, to ſpare the Goods and Eſtate of an Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Appartment of the Elect'reſs is admirable, and her Highneſs was ſo Gracious as to permit that it ſhou'd be ſhewn to me. There is nothing to be ſeen but Gold and Azure, but that is what I leaſt conſider'd: The Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Moveables are ſo ſumptuous, and the Attire ſo ſplendid, that if I had not known that ſhe was deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Royal Stock of <hi>Savoy,</hi> I might eaſily have gueſs'd that this Neatneſs came from beyond the <hi>Alps.</hi> Indeed <hi>Italy</hi> is the very Source of it; ſo that the reſt of the World in this particular Circumſtance, is only the Copy of which that Country is the true Original.</p>
               <p>I have alſo this farther Obligation to his Electoral Highneſs's Favours, that he has thought fit to give me a Sight of his Repoſitory of Curioſities and Medals: For his Highneſs ſent me word that he was to go a Hunting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Morning, and that he wou'd leave Orders to ſhew me all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42254:59"/>
things: And indeed, I receiv'd notice from an Officer of the Houſhold of the Day and Hour.</p>
               <p>I was at firſt introduc'd into the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the Elector himſelf, and into a Gallery of Paintings, which were all of exquiſite Beauty: In the ſpaces by which they are ſeparated, divers Preſſes are fixt along the thickneſs of the Wall; where I ſaw as rich Jewels as any that are extant in the World. There is abundance of Precious-ſtones, and ſome Oriental Pearls, beſides others of the Country, which were taken out of that little River which unloads it ſelf at <hi>Paſſaw</hi> into the <hi>Danube.</hi> In theſe laſt, the different progreſſes of Nature in the bringing 'em to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is more eſpecially remarkable: For ſome are black, which is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of that firſt Matter that aſſumes its Solidity: Others are grey, in which it may be perceiv'd that this Matter begins to grow clear. Others again are whitiſh, and others perfectly white. I plainly diſcover'd upon theſe little Creatures the immediate Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42254:59"/>
of Heaven, which communicated to 'em by degrees that Whiteneſs and that Aſtral Luſtre. Then was ſhewn to me the Garter which the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> loſt in the Defeat of <hi>Prague,</hi> where the Deviſe of the Order is ſet in Characters of Diamonds. I there took a view of the Works of <hi>Raphael <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin, Albert Durer,</hi> and <hi>Lucas Leidenſis,</hi> and particularly admir'd the Draughts of a certain Painter of <hi>Augsburg,</hi> who ſerv'd the Emperor <hi>Rodolph;</hi> but I was much ſurpris'd at the Tediouſneſs of his Work, there being nothing that comes near it; ſo that it may be affirm'd that none but <hi>Germans</hi> can be capable of ſo great Patience. I alſo took delight in viewing the Gold-ſmith's Ware of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and an Ivory-Veſſel, which his Electoral Highneſs turn'd with his own Hand. The moſt part of the Princes and Noble-men of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> have ſome in-ſight in the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, and perhaps from their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Children are inſtructed therein. The ſame Practice
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42254:60"/>
has prevail'd likewiſe among the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi> Gentry, even upon a very Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick account; for they pretend by this means to have an opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing their Quality, when they are made Priſoners of War, and to avoid a Ranſom, which wou'd be their ruin.</p>
               <p>But I have inſiſted too long upon theſe Particulars, when there is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſay ſomewhat concerning the Medals, among which (my Lord) I have ſeen Wonders. A Cabinet of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar three Foot high, ſerves only as a covering to another, which is much more precious; 'tis made of Ivory wrought with Figures, the Order, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Work-manſhip of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed every thing that I have ſeen elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in this kind. There are 1400 Gold Medals contain'd in twenty Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves: Their Beauty conſiſts in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; for as for the <hi>Graecian</hi> and <hi>Conſular,</hi> of which there may be three or four hundred, tho' they are exactly counterfeited, yet Truth and Antiquity is altogether wanting to 'em. I was inform'd that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42254:60"/>
a Jeſuit, to whoſe management they were committed, cou'd not ſatisfy the Elector's Curioſity, by any means than by cauſing thoſe that were wanting and cou'd be recover'd, to be copy'd in Gold, at any expence whatever. I confeſs, that theſe Copies are ſo accurate, that I was even ſurpris'd at the ſight of 'em, and that I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſpend ſome time in the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of 'em. There are two or three hundred admirable Pieces among the Imperial, which are capable of charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eyes even of the moſt inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Beholders. I expected to have ſeen thoſe of Silver and Copper, but they were not ſhewn to me. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer whom I entreated with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Civility, to give me entire Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reply'd, that he had a Charge to do ſo, but that he knew of no other Medals than thoſe that I had already ſeen. I was alſo inform'd afterward, that they had incurr'd the ſame Fate with great ſtore of other Riches, that were tranſported out of <hi>Germany</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:42254:61"/>To conclude, nothing was wanting to compleat the Delights that I took in the City of <hi>Munick.</hi> But of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which I receiv'd from the Prince both publickly and in private, that of having enjoy'd his Treaſures as I thought fit, to the ſight of which very few Perſons are admitted, engages me to an acknowledgment; which ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and magnificent <hi>Idea</hi>'s of 'em that are ſtill imprinted upon my Mind will render everlaſting.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Herman</hi> ought to have the greateſt ſhare in this Diſcourſe: He is his Electoral Highneſs's Favourite, and (as I have reaſon to believe) his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Merit has procur'd him this Happineſs. The Illuſtrious Name of <hi>Furſtemberg</hi> is alſo very auſpicious; for the Goods of Fortune, and the moſt ſublime Endowments of the Mind are inſeparably annex'd thereto; but ſo many Ages that have honour'd it, have done leſs for its Glory than the three Princes to whom it now belongs. One ſingle Place of <hi>Europe</hi> wou'd not be a Theatre large enough for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42254:61"/>
of their Princely Vertues; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Heaven has ſeparated them, and without explaining my ſelf any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for ſo ample a Subject is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that of a Letter) their <hi>Genius</hi> is every where the Source of the Political Function, and their admirable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Ornament of the Court.</p>

For
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42254:62"/>
this ſort of Drink is only at moſt a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Paſte, which ſerves to nouriſh the Belly and Stomach, but does not affect the upper Region of the Brain, to which the Animal Spirits reſort to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Aliments. It is not impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with thoſe Divine Atoms that inflame the Imagination, and drive away Melancholy, and even Sorrow it ſelf. Indeed the uſe of Reaſon may be taken away by drinking this Liquor to exceſs, but without any Delight, and the Soul languiſhes under a heavy Oppreſſion. Upon this account it is (my Lord) that your Territories are ſo much talkt of; and that the People have ſo great an Eſteem for the Wines of the <hi>Necker,</hi> which noble River con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys 'em a great deal higher than <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart;</hi> as alſo that they make ſo good a Return for the Pains that are taken in Tranſporting 'em ſo far.</p>
               <p>The Riches of this Country are not divided; neither are they to be found any where but at Court and among the Clergy, all thoſe that are below this Quality having no ſhare in 'em. The
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42254:62"/>
ſame Cuſtom is not obſerv'd there as in other Places, where the Coin circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates through all the parts of the State, and enriches the People of all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The Gentry, Prieſts, and Monks are wealthy, but the Peaſants languiſh under a ſordid Poverty; ſo that this Diſpenſation may be ſaid to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Idea</hi> of that Statue of the Prophet, which had the Head of Gold, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Silver, and the Feet of Clay. But the Caſe is quite different (my Lord) in your Dominions; for the Peaſants of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> do not ſtand in need of any thing, as enjoying not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatever is neceſſary, but alſo that which is convenient, even to all thoſe comforts and delights that this World can afford. I obſerv'd nothing like it in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> perhaps becauſe I only ſaw the worſt part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or happen'd to be there in a bad Seaſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bavarians</hi> appear'd to me to be very ſtupid and clowniſh, but I do not ſpeak of the Perſons of Quality, whom their Birth diſtinguiſhes, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42254:63"/>
their Education renders polite; for the Common People, and the reſt of the Scum of the Nation, only deſerve this Character. It is almoſt every where known what courſe of Life thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lead, who are met with along the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and how lightly they are eſteem'd; neither have the Men a greater ſtock of Merit. It was an appoſite ſaying of <hi>Homer,</hi> that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> had taken away Common Senſe from Slaves, and Beggers for the moſt part are altogether Sots.

inequality, which wou'd inceſſantly diſturb the order of things in the World, if thoſe who are ſo ill provided for, had ſo much ſenſe as to know how to reſent their Miſery? We obſerve that all Men endeavour to find delight in their reſpective Conditions, and that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of every State, is the ſecret Foundation upon which Civil Society is grounded. And when by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Revolution, of which there are frequent Examples, we ſee the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of thoſe of low degree, and the fall of great ones, it ſo happens (my Lord) becauſe the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the former is enlighten'd, and that the others have loſt their diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faculty, and the knowledge of Good and Evil.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal of Religion among the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and their Zeal is more eſpecially extended to matters of Controverſy: But their Neighbours accuſe 'em of neglecting the main Points of it, to adhere to Triffles; they believe that their Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is vagrant, and that Chriſtianity
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42254:64"/>
has made a farther Progreſs among 'em than it ought. A certain <hi>Puritan</hi> who bore no great Affection toward 'em, accoſted me after this manner: <hi>Are you</hi> French-<hi>Men more enlighten'd, notwithſtanding your recourſe to the Spring-head? All theſe foreign Means, all theſe pretended Interceſſions do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found you; you are of our Humour, you are of no Religion, and yet cry out for a pure one: If you have broken all meaſures with</hi> Rome, <hi>which no longer holds you but by a ſmall Thread, we ſhall be ſoon agree'd.</hi> I confeſs, (my Lord) that he ſhew'd me more kindneſs than I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd; but without troubling your Highneſs with the Anſwer I made him, which was very large, I ſhall only inſiſt briefly on the two laſt Points: I told him then, <hi>That there were in</hi> France <hi>as many true Chriſtians as in any other Place; and that we knew the Diſtinction which ought to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Rome <hi>and the</hi> Holy See; <hi>between the Vicar of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince; between the Succeſſor of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and the Donatary of</hi> Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magn;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42254:64"/>
                  <hi>between the Pope and the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician; that we readily acknowledg'd his Spiritual Supremacy; and that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd thereto, not by the means of a String; but by a cordial and voluntary Submiſſion, by Faith and Grace; and that as for our Eſtates, Goods, Interests, and every thing elſe that does not relate to matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; they were independant of His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs's Dominion, who had no other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Church than thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his own Territories and Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Perhaps this Diſcourſe may be too tedious upon ſuch an occaſion, and I ſhall add no more at preſent, but that 'tis requiſite to take an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make mention to your Highneſs of a notable Divertiſement, which I ſaw in your Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>It is not known in <hi>France,</hi> what is meant by a Sledge, nor what the <hi>Wirtſchaft</hi> is; neither are the Ladies there accuſtom'd to run at the Ring. I was pleaſantly ſurpris'd to ſee a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter A-la-mode, or a Winter Traveſty; as alſo Froſt and Snow apply'd to the uſe of Gallantry, and ſo many exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42254:65"/>
Beauties diſplay'd in a Plain: The Sumptuouſneſs of their Apparel, and the the Statelineſs of their Deportment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to my ſight as it were ſo many Deities and Amazons: They were moſt magnificently mounted on Triumphal Chariots, and paſs d before my Eyes as ſwift as Lightning: I know not whether thoſe flying Machines were ſo many Ships ſailing upon dry Land, or Chariots running upon a ſolid Water: They ſeem'd to me ſometimes to be a crowd of Goddeſſes in Clouds of Gold and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure, that had lately cut the Air and lighted upon the Ground, on purpoſe to enjoy thoſe Delights that the Winter alone (which they have not in Heaven) is capable of affording 'em. The Sports were different; ſome were terminated in the ſwiftneſs of the Courſe; and in others, there was Honour to be acquir'd, becauſe there were Victories to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was a very extraordinary Object to behold a Lady with a Lance in her Hand, endu'd with the ſprightlineſs and and fiery Temper of an Hero; as alſo to obſerve Vigour and Fortitude ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42254:65"/>
amidſt the Charms of Beauty, &amp; a Female Warrior running her ſelf into danger wherever there was any proſpect of Glory, with a precipitate Forwardneſs that ſhew'd nothing of that Weakneſs and Timorouſneſs, which is ſo natural to her Sex. Laſtly, (my Lord) the Pomp was ſo great, that it was leſs a Career than a ſpacious Theatre, which reach'd even out of ſight, having the Divertiſements of the Gods for its Scene, and the lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Winter for its Decoration. I know not whether the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> wou'd have laid out ſo much expences in the management of their <hi>Naumachiae,</hi> or Sea-fights repreſented upon Land, if they had known the ſecret of Sailing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Snow as the <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have no Expreſſions ſublime enough to declare to your Highneſs, what I then thought of the two Princeſſes of <hi>Baden-Durlach.</hi> They are always extremely beautiful, but their Attire on that day, their graceful Meen, and their Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in performing all the Exploits of the Career transform'd 'em into <hi>Heroines.</hi> The Princeſs <hi>Catharine Barba,</hi> who was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42254:66"/>
dreſs'd in the habit of an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> did me the Honour to ask me how I lik'd her: I anſwer'd bluntly, That ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me more charming than <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra;</hi> I ought to have added, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſomewhat more than <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Antony;</hi> but I had ſo much the leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mind, as my Eyes were more employ'd in viewing theſe delectable Objects. The Princeſs her Siſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd likewiſe in the Garb of a Peaſant; and the Lot which divided theſe ſorts of Characters fell very appoſitely: For the natural plainneſs and ſimplicity which ſhe communicated to her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, compleated the lively Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Country-Woman in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the moſt beautiful Princeſs in the World. Inſomuch that a certain Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who believ'd what he ſaw in good earneſt, accoſted her after a familiar manner, ſeem'd to be well pleas'd with her Company, and after having infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelf of part of what he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know, askt her where the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was; She reply'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, without any change of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42254:66"/>
that he ſhou'd ſee her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and that ſhe wou'd not fail to be preſent at the Ball. Thus the whole Intrigue was pleaſantly carry'd on, and the good Man made much ſport during the Feſtival, without knowing any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>At my return, I took particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a kind of Foppery, which afforded me an agreeable Diverſion, by reaſon of the relation it had to the manner of the Ancients. In <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm</hi> and its Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the Women and young Maidens uſually wear their Hair platted up back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as it were a Mat, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ty'd with a Riband. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Faſhion prevail'd among 'em two thouſand Years ago, at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Report of <hi>Tacitus, Inſigne Gentis Suevorum obliquare crinem, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doque ſubſtringere. It is the peculiar Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the</hi> Suevi, <hi>or Inhabitants of</hi> Schwaben, <hi>to wear their Hair curl'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tufts, and to tye it with a Knot.</hi> This illuſtrious Hiſtorian makes ſome other notable Remarks concerning theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which may not be improperly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42254:67"/>
to thoſe of <hi>Wirtemberg. It is not known</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in thoſe Parts what is meant by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, by which means the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are more free from it, than if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were prohibited by a Law: They do not ſpare drinking there, and they ſometimes ſpend a whole Day and Night, without giving any occaſion of reproaching 'em upon that account: They are very courteous in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Strangers, and no Nation can boast of being more addicted to Hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants are ſo equitable, that they even ſurpaſs the wholeſome Laws of other People: They are leſs corrupted than in any other Part of the World: Nothing is exacted among 'em by Authority; ſo that the most gentle means as that of Perſwaſion, are ſufficient for the obtaining of whatever one deſires. They Adore the Goddeſs</hi> Iſis, <hi>and offer up to her the greatest number of Sacrifices.</hi> Theſe laſt Words ſufficiently explain the Original of ſo many Altars and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, which your Highneſs has done me the Honour to cauſe to be ſhewn to me at <hi>Stugart. Tacitus,</hi> who never receiv'd any Benefit from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42254:67"/>
of <hi>Schwaben,</hi> has frequently afforded divers little Teſtimonials in their praiſe, which he cou'd not deny to the Truth of his Deſcriptions. Indeed I lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Obligation of making many more, as being better acquainted with the Country than he, and loaded with a multitude of Favours by its Sovereign Prince: But 'tis requiſite to be <hi>Tacitus,</hi> to be capable of doing it effectually, and I am ſenſible that my Abilities are not ſufficient for ſuch an Undertaking.</p>
               <p>I ſhall leave Your Highneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template upon theſe noble <hi>Idea</hi>'s, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they may inſpire you with ſo much Gayety of Humour, as may ſerve to diſperſe that melancholy, which I fear my unpoliſh'd and impertinent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>courſe has caus'd in your Mind. But Sovereign Princes act in a Sphere ſo far above other Men; that they ought not to expect any thing of 'em that is worth their Acceptance, or in any wiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to their Grandeur: Neither are they wont to deſpiſe the ſmalleſt Preſents that are made to 'em; ſince their Generoſity is ſuch as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42254:68"/>
even the firſt motions of Zeal with which their Subjects are incited either to ſerve or to divert 'em. Upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe Conſiderations, it is (my Lord) that in doing nothing for your Service, I hope to get ſome Advantage for my ſelf, and that I preſume with ſo much boldneſs to aſſure you that I am, and ſhall be during my whole Life, with all manner of profound Reſpect;</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42254:69"/>
to you as the former; neither can I pretend to ground 'em upon any thing elſe, but the reſpectful Obedience which I owe to your Commands.</p>
            <p>Not but that (my Lord) I might flatter my ſelf with an Aſſurance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable even to offer ſuch Things as wou'd afford ſome kind of Diverſion to your moſt Serene Highneſs, either upon account of their Novelty or Variety. But (my Lord) how extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult it is! for a Perſon endu'd with ſo mean Abilities as mine are, to entertain a Potent Prince as knowing and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as your Highneſs, and to hope for a good iſſue of ſuch an Entertainment: However (my Lord) you are deſirous of it, you are pleas'd to command it, and I am alſo ſenſible that this kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue is offenſive to you. Therefore I ſhall put an end to my Apology, and yield a ready Obedience without any farther delays.</p>
            <p>Nothing affords ſo much delight and ſatisfaction as Travelling; (my Lord) your moſt Serene Highneſs has thought fit to tell me ſo ſometimes, and I have
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42254:69"/>
ever found it true. Indeed the Epitaph of the great <hi>Trivulcio</hi> might well be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to me, before-hand, <hi>Hic quieſcit qui nunquam quievit. Here rests he that never reſted.</hi> It ſeems as if the Air which I draw in by Reſpiration in different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, inſpir'd me with new Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, at leaſt it ſupplies me with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for new Meditations; neither do I take any notice of ſuch ſorts of Varieties as ſurpriſe the moſt part of thoſe that never had a ſight of 'em; yet I often find an opportunity to ſpend my time to better purpoſe. I do not inſiſt on the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Habits in every Nation, altho' there are ſome ſo odd, that they even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ridiculous. I have ſometimes ſought for the Reaſon or Original of 'em, but cou'd never diſcover it; neither did I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find it any where but in Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Decency, which in my mind, are the two Rules to be obſerv'd in Cloathing. However, I was oblig'd to be content with the ordinary Faſhions, that is to ſay, the Cuſtom of thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who make uſe of 'em: Beſides, this Cuſtom which <hi>Herodotus</hi> treats with the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42254:70"/>
ſtyle of Royal, is a kind of Supreme Law, more eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> where Novelty is not ſo eaſily admitted as in other Places: Thus a Houſe is uſually rebuilt after the very ſame Model that 'twas built in the preceeding Age, and if a Man ſhou'd go about to perſwade a Proprietary never ſo little to make the Structure more regular, to give it more light, to diminiſh the thickneſs of its Walls, and to deviate ſomewhat from the ancient manner of Building, on purpoſe to take the advantage of ſo many Conveniences that ariſe from the more refin'd modern Architecture; he wou'd immediately anſwer, that he derided the new Mode; that his deceaſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or his Grand-father were very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Perſons; and that they had caus'd the exact Dimenſions of this Houſe to be taken, ſuch as they now appear to be, if perhaps even they had not receiv'd the Model from their Predeceſſors; but in a Word, that he was reſolv'd to make no alteration.</p>
            <p>The ſame Temper is alſo obſervable with ſome ſort of rigour in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42254:70"/>
of the moſt part of other Arts, which are practis'd even at this day in thoſe Parts after the ſame manner as under <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> altho' a thouſand conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Inventions have been found out ſince his Reign, and very many more Works are brought to Perfection, with a much leſs expence both of Mony and Time. I was ſurpris'd to ſee Meat dreſs'd in many Places, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes it to be done by thoſe <hi>Germans,</hi> whom he knew only to be <hi>Barbarians:</hi> It is true indeed, that in others particularly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Territories (my Lord) this ancient manner has been long ſince laid aſide, and no other is follow'd but that which is wholſome, neat and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. As for the Art of Phyſick, I have a ſomewhat greater knowledge of it, and have obſerv'd that almoſt every where they make uſe of a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Drugs, and of that Method of Practice which prevail'd two thouſand years ago, as if we were <hi>Socrates</hi>'s or <hi>Epaminondas</hi>'s, without making any Reflection, that the diverſity of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, Aliments and Cuſtoms, which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42254:71"/>
alter the Bodies of Men and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; produce new Symptoms and Circumſtances in Diſeaſes; and require new Remedies; or at leaſt a different Application of the old ones. There was ſcarce a Woman that did not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me, for not preſcribing a Doſe of <hi>Hellebore</hi> according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Form. Therefore without alledging any other Reaſon, altho' I might have done it; I reply'd, that People were in this Age much more ſenſleſs and ſilly than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and that upon that account quite different Remedies were to be apply'd.</p>
            <p>The Argumentation which might be made upon theſe Cuſtoms wou'd be without doubt very tedious at leaſt too prolix for your Approbation (my Lord) and for my own Inclination; ſo that I ſhall confine my Diſcourſe to thoſe Matters that have the neareſt relation to both; and to thoſe that have not been as yet ſo copiouſly treated of as Pieces of Morality; on which Subject I meet with Books almoſt every where, as I am travelling.</p>

               <p>Is the firſt City that preſents it ſelf to my Mind, perhaps becauſe 'twas the firſt that I ſaw among thoſe, of which I have ſome account to give to your moſt Serene Highneſs: Its Political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Strength, Alliances and State of Religion, are well known to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and to your Highneſs more than any other Perſon, and ſo much the rather, in regard that you are Maſter of ſome Territories which are diſtant only a quarter of an hours Journey from thence; as alſo that you always honour this Republick with your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and often with your Preſence. I might perhaps have taken there ſome ſingular Obſervations which wou'd have afforded ſome Satisfaction to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Some of my Friends, who are almoſt always to be ſuppos'd Men of Learning, and ever of good Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, conducted me within two Leagues of the City; here you may be pleas'd to take notice by the way,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42254:72"/>
that my Leagues are equivalent only to the <hi>German</hi> half Leagues, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd Hours, by reaſon of the time that a Man may ſpend in paſſing it on foot with his ordinary Pace. There we view'd the Ruins of that ancient City, which gave to <hi>Baſil</hi> the Title of <hi>Auguſta Rauracorum,</hi> the name of the Village that remains having very much relation thereto; For</p>

               <p>Undoubtedly derives its Etymology from <hi>Auguſta.</hi> The adjacent Country is altogether full of theſe old Ruins; ſo that we took much delight in going on foot about the diſtance of half an hours Journey from the principal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where we perceiv'd in a Foreſt an Opening, which diſcover'd to us a vaulted Canal, with ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable remnant of Architecture. It is reported that it ſerv'd as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queduct; for the Place which is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on very high Ground ſeems to demonſtrate it; but others affirm that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42254:72"/>
'twas a ſecret Paſſage for Forces in caſe of Neceſſity; for 'twas as it were the Lodgment of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who Marching from the <hi>Black Forest,</hi> call'd <hi>Sylva Hercynia</hi> in the ancient Maps, endeavour'd to paſs the <hi>Rhine</hi> there, to make their Incurſions againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> The principal Caſtle, which is now known to the Inhabitants of the Country by the name of <hi>Das Scolfs,</hi> might alſo have been a part of the Town, and was one of thoſe three with which the Paſſage of the <hi>Rhine</hi> was fortify'd, which being lower in thoſe Parts than elſewhere, may be ſo much the more eaſily travers'd. <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſtus</hi> eſcap'd thither after having been defeated by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſome time after, <hi>Druſus</hi> caus'd to be built in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood the Burgh of Guards, which ſtill even at this day bears the name of <hi>Bartemburg.</hi> The <hi>Salt-Tower</hi> which remains at <hi>Baſil</hi> near the Bridge is built after the ſame manner, inſomuch that it may well be preſum'd that thoſe three ſorts of Caſtles, were erected on purpoſe to diſcover the Enemies with greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42254:73"/>
and vigorouſly to oppoſe their Paſſage, on whatever ſide they ſhou'd attempt it. However, the Place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all the pains that we took in the viewing of it; and it appears by the name of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were ſettl'd there, as in a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton convenient for making head againſt the <hi>Germans;</hi> as alſo that they built this Fort of which appear ſuch ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ruins: Nay 'tis very probable that they founded a great City there, as well in regard that this name of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta</hi> was attributed by 'em only to Capital Cities, as <hi>Auguſta Trinobantum, Auguſta Trevirorum, Auguſta Vindelico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> as by reaſon of the vaſt number of Stones and other Materials which are found in the neighbouring Fields, none of 'em being to be ſeen in thoſe that are ſuppos'd to have been ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated without the compaſs of the Walls. The Ditches and Walls are in many Places ſuch as they were a thouſand Years ago, and the manner of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Stones is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable, at leaſt according to the

Judgment of the moſt skilful Maſons of the preſent Age, who acknowledge that they know nothing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that they are not able to comprehend it. But that which chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited our Curioſity was, that the laſt Towers, of which we reckon'd up nine within the whole Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence are all flank'd on the inſide, contrary to the Rules of modern Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, which is infinitely more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular than the ancient: 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that this method was more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventageous in the Defence of thoſe Times; for the battering Rams which were the ſtrongeſt Machines, were apt to fly in pieces when run againſt the Concave of a Tower, whereas they might break it down down if it were Convex. One of our Company af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that as in the Amphitheaters, and other <hi>Roman</hi> Buildings, there were Niches on the inſide, in which wild Beaſts were uſually ſhut up for the magnificence of their publick Shews, or the Puniſhment of Malefactors, ſo theſe perhaps might have had the

               <p>This Learned Man was of opinion that there was a Theatre compos'd of four Towers, every one of 'em be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated by a Stair-caſe; ſo that the Spectators might reſort thither at all times through theſe eaſy Paſſages, and place themſelves conveniently at their leiſure. 'Tis probable that the Thought is true, at leaſt it ſeem'd to me to be very fine. Therefore I have caus'd two Proſpects of this Theatre to be engrav'd according to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Memoires, with three ancient Inſcriptions. The two Former were found in his time, and the third is to be ſeen in the <hi>Muſaeum</hi> of M. <hi>Feſch,</hi> to whom a Peaſant of <hi>Augst</hi> brought it a little while ago.</p>

Was it not in a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition even in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and has it not languiſh'd for about Twelve Hundred Years? <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was full of Barbarians as well as Barbarity. What Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cou'd be made of the State of the Provinces, which had no Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor Politeneſs, but what was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to 'em from <hi>Rome?</hi> Humane Literature, has indeed at laſt recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Vigour ſince about an Age or two, but 'tis entirely owing to the Induſtry of curious Inquirers, who have as it were dug up Learning and Truth that lay bury'd in Oblivion. I cou'd willingly erect a publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to the Memory of ſo many Illuſtrious Perſonages, who have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd themſelves in this Work to very good purpoſe, were it not that I remember that I am writing a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42254:77"/>
and not a Panegyrick. Give me leave nevertheleſs (my Lord) to ſet a part three out of this Honourable Company, whoſe Merit was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; ſince this <hi>Encomium</hi> is due to their Labours, Travels, Expences, and to the deſign they had of doing Service to the Common-wealth. All theſe three Heroes were furniſh'd with very large Libraries, rare Manuſcripts, and moſt curious ancient Medals. It may be juſtly avouch'd that <hi>Augerius Busbequius</hi> that Noble Ambaſſador, whoſe two admirable Relations of his Embaſſies are as yet extant, has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd the World, and particularly the Auguſt Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> whom he ſerv'd, with an infinite number of Manuſcripts and Medals, that were in danger of being utterly loſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Aſſiſtance. Monſieur <hi>de Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſc,</hi> Councellour to the Parliament of <hi>Ais,</hi> was much honour'd by all the Learned Men of the Age in which he liv'd; but Poſterity ought to have a greater Veneration for his Memory,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42254:77"/>
although 'twere only upon account of that excellent Treaſure of Medals, which he heap'd up: I have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Thouſand <hi>Graecian</hi> Coins that were taken from thence; this very Word (my Lord) is precious, and though it be a kind of Riddle to the moſt part of Mankind, yet 'tis not ſo to your Highneſs. This ſame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Peireſc</hi> was the only Perſon of his time, that cou'd read the <hi>Greek</hi> upon the Medals, and was capable of explaining it. <hi>Amerbachius,</hi> for whoſe ſake I have made this Digreſſion, is the third Hero: I have read many of his Letters all full of Learning and Elegancy; He held Correſpondence with the moſt part of Men of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who then flouriſh'd, that is to ſay, with the Learned, and the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Lovers of Curioſity; but he maintain'd a very ſtrict one with <hi>Occo,</hi> that illuſtrious Antiquary and Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of <hi>Augsburg.</hi> This very Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone deſerves Commendation; and if future Ages ſhou'd forget <hi>Amerbachius,</hi>

the Univerſity of <hi>Baſil</hi> which ſtill poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes his Library and Repoſitory, wou'd have ſufficient proofs to convict 'em of Ingratitude.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to illuſtrate the <hi>Idea</hi> of it, I have taken care for the Engraving of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Combats with Beaſts, after the ſame manner as they were order'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients, and as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us in their Medals.</p>

It was the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Cavern, thro' which that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gentleman M. <hi>Platerus</hi> made no difficulty to get out, with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn in his Hand, after he had taken a view of all thoſe ſecret Receſſes. It may not be improper here to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to Your Highneſs concerning this M. <hi>Platerus,</hi> whom they took for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or at leaſt for an Inchanter. He is a Profeſſor of Phyſick, and a Man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Parts, and of a moſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel Carriage, being the Son, Grand-Son, and as I take it, the Great Grand-Son

Son of a Phyſician, which anſwers to what was heretofore call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. The fine <hi>Muſoeum</hi> or Repoſitory of Rarities, which is carefully kept in the poſſeſſion of his Family, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigram which <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> wrote in its commendation are ſufficient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of the Learning and Ingenuity, of the Proprietaries: There is neither Plant, Metal, Mineral, Figure, nor any extraordinary Curioſity which is not contain'd in this rich Treaſury. There are alſo ſome of thoſe kinds of Rarities, for which the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have a greater Veneration than thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and among others a precious Relick of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Crown of Thorns. There are alſo divers Medals, but let us not leave <hi>Augſt</hi> without acquainting Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſome of 'em are often met with in tilling the ground. I have heard as much of many Perſons, and have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeen ſome of 'em of all ſorts of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. I went myſelf to the Cottages of divers honeſt Country-men therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42254:81"/>
who ſhew'd me ſome that they had found a few daies ago, and among others I procur'd one of <hi>Delmatius,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> with the <hi>Labarum</hi> or Imperial Standard, and the mark of JESUS CHRIST. I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that in the payment which I made 'em, they twice lookt earneſtly upon my Money; nay theſe ignorant People were ſo ſimple as to fear, leſt ſometime after, it ſhould turn into Oak leaves.</p>
               <p>But at <hi>Baſil</hi> they were much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe undeceiv'd, and in that City I have ſeen many Perſons of better ſence, without doing any injury to the others. There they delight much in Learning and Integrity; which is a Union that is very ſeldom to be met with, and which affords me extream ſatisfaction. The Oriental Languages have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moſt carefully cultivated there, and the Learned <hi>Buxtorfius,</hi> who is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of 'em, perfectly anſwers the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which his Father had acquir'd, of being the moſt Skilful Maſter of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>

Tongue in the World. If M. <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> were as well vers'd in Divinity, as in all the other Parts of Human Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it might be avouch'd that he has attain'd to the higheſt degree of perfection in that Science; but foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I have but little knowledge of Divinity, and leſs of that ſort which is there Taught, I ſhall leave his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to others, who are capable of doing it to better advantage: But I muſt add that he is the moſt obliging Perſon in the World; and that he has a Son who is no leſs ſo than himſelf; whoſe Youth is adorn'd with as many Sciences and ſingular Endowments, as are requiſite for an able Divine. The Famous Profeſſor <hi>Bauhinus</hi> has ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſignaliz'd himſelf by his Works, without ſtanding in need of my aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, neither will I undertake to compoſe an <hi>Encomiaſtick</hi> in his favour; but only declare him to be one of the moſt Accompliſh'd and Polite Men in the World, that he has a great affection both for me and my Father, and is

belov'd by all Perſons of Honour. To conclude, this Country is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full of ſuch Illuſtrious Perſonages, and among others we muſt not forget M. <hi>Battier,</hi> who perhaps has attain'd to the knowledge of as many curious Sciences as ever were known in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> and has made very good uſe of the time which he ſpent at <hi>Paris,</hi> in converſing with Learned Men, and particularly with Mr. <hi>Juſtel:</hi> He has alſo a Couſin, whoſe Name is known to Your Highneſs. Beſides that, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Feſch</hi>'s is one of the moſt conſiderable in the City, give me leave (My Lord) to tell you, that 'tis alſo one of the moſt Numerous, as it will appear from this ſingle Example. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph Feſch</hi> Burgomaſter, and the Son of a Burgomaſter; after ſixty years of marriage with <hi>Ann Gebveiler,</hi> ſaw one hundred ſixty and five Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by himſelf, his Children, and Grand-Children: One of theſe is nam'd <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and has in his poſſeſſion one

of the fineſt Repoſitories in <hi>Germany.</hi> His Houſe is a Palace, and Your moſt Serene Highneſs is very ſenſible, that theſe Republicans are not only content but well pleas'd with their manner of living; neither could I have ever imagin'd that they were endu'd with ſo much Politeneſs. But let us leave the Outworks and enter the Repoſitory it ſelf, where nothing is wanting; for there are Paintings, Sculptures, Books, and other Curioſities of all ſorts: As for the Medals (My Lord) ſince Your Highneſs does not refuſe to honour me ſo far as to give credit to my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without an Oath, I hope you'll take my word in this particular. There are ſome ſo ſingular, that they are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing; neither have they any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Memoires which I have of other Repoſitories, or to the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Authors, or to thoſe that I have ſeen elſewhere. The Poſſeſſor of 'em bears not only the ſame ſincere affection toward me, as all other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

Perſons of my Acquaintance, but alſo ſhews that ſweetneſ of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation which the <hi>Graecians</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which is not conformable to what is commonly reported con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who are reputed to be a dull and ruſtical ſort of People: I have ſometimes convers'd with, and have held correſpondence with 'em in different Countries, and never perceiv'd any ſuch quality inherent in 'em: I have obſerv'd 'em generally ſpeaking, to be Induſtrious, Faithful, Accurate, Sincere, Candid, and for the moſt part very Learned; nay I have been ſurpriz'd to meet with ſome, who have attain'd to the higheſt degree of Politeneſs. I ſhall not inſiſt upon their Religion nor Civil Government. Theſe People (as they ſay) are well vers'd in matters relating to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and I am throughly perſuaded that they are perfectly well skill'd in the other. I ſhall only beg leave of your Moſt Serene Highneſs to add a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42254:84"/>
word or two, concerning the extream kindneſs that M. <hi>Feſch</hi> ſhew'd me, and in which (My Lord) you have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Intereſt than perhaps you are aware of: He permitted me to take a Draught with a Pen of all thoſe Rare Medals that I have already mention'd to Your Highneſs: This was to procure me a ſmall Treaſure without diminiſhing his own, and to lay an everlaſting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon me, by ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>Again (My Lord) the Curioſities to be ſeen in the City of <hi>Baſil</hi> are exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded yet farther; for I am unwilling to let ſlip an opportunity of entertaining Your Highneſs with the Deſcription of another Repoſitory, which is very much talk'd of, upon account of its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Founders, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Amerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> whoſe Memory is highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd in that Countrey, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges them as the Reſtorers of good Literature. The firſt of theſe is Painted half way, by <hi>Holbein,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42254:84"/>
that Picture this very Ingenious Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram was Compos'd:
<q>
                     <l>Ingens ingentem quem perſonat Orbis <hi>Eraſmum,</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This Repoſitory belongs to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Baſil,</hi> by vertue of a Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made by the Magiſtrates of the City, who had purchas'd it with the ſumm of a thouſand Crowns, of the Heirs of <hi>Amerbachius,</hi> the Legatee of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> whoſe laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as yet preſerv'd, written with his own Hand. There is alſo in the great Church a Sumptuous piece of Marble, wrought according to the Rules of Architecture, which confirms this Account by its Inſcription. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42254:85"/>
of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> to be ſeen there, ſeems to have taken its Type from the God <hi>Terminus,</hi> who is repreſented on the front of that Inſcription, which was made on purpoſe to honour the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Great Man.</p>
               <p>That, which alone would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to procure the higheſt eſteem for this Repoſitory, is a ſcore of <hi>Holbein</hi>'s Originals, and among others that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucifi'd, for which a thouſand Ducats have been proffer'd. Thoſe that are ignorant of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Skill of this Painter, need only take a journey to <hi>Baſil</hi> to be well aſſur'd of it. There the Citizens would ſhew 'em in the Town-Houſe a large Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn by his Hand, or rather eight ſeveral Paintings of one Piece, which repreſent ſo many different Acts of the Paſſion. 'Tis in my mind, one of the fineſt Pieces in the World: And I do not admire that the Deceas'd Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> thought fit to offer to the City a quantity of Salt, amounting to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42254:85"/>
of twenty thouſand Crowns, for ſo choice a Rarity.</p>
               <p>Give me leave (My Lord) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with ſomewhat concerning this <hi>Holbein:</hi> He was a Gallant Man, but ſo extreamly neceſſitous, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he had not wherewith to pay for his Dinner. In another Painting of the ſame Repoſitory, are drawn the Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his Wife and Children, whoſe Apparel argues that they were very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better ſupply'd with Neceſſaries. In a word, this Painting is a Treaſure in Raggs. All Travellers uſually ſtop with delight at the corner of a narrow ſtreet in <hi>Baſil,</hi> where is to be ſeen a Houſe, Painted on the outſide from the top to the bottom by <hi>Holbein</hi>'s incomparable Hand: Indeed even great Princes might take it as an Honour to have ſo Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a piece of Workmanſhip in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; nevertheleſs 'twas only the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which this poor Painter made for ſome Meals, which he had there taken: for it was a Victualing-Houſe; the ſituation of which as well as its
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42254:86"/>
meanneſs ſufficiently ſhews that 'twas none of the moſt noted. Our <hi>Holbein</hi> was at laſt deliver'd out of this miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition, by the Generoſity of an Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> from whom was deſcended that Illuſtrious <hi>Engliſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, whom Curioſity has as it were render'd immortal, as well as the vaſt number of ancient Inſcriptions and Marbles, as yet to be ſeen in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which he had ſent for from the <hi>Levant</hi> and which were ſo Learnedly and fortunately explain'd by Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi> This Book, by the way, is very ſcarce, but if it be not in Your Highneſs's Library, you need not be concern'd, for 'tis about to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and I have been told that the new Edition will be much finer and larger than the former. This Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> as he was returning (if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not) from an Embaſſy to <hi>Vienna,</hi> brought over along with him <hi>Holbein</hi> and his whole Family, and advanc'd his Fortune ſo far, that <hi>Holbein</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cry'd out; <hi>Is it poſſible, that ever
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42254:86"/>
I ſhoud have been ſo indigent as to be forc'd to Paint to get a ſorry livelyhood?</hi> Theſe are the effects of the diſcerning Judgment and generous Diſpoſition of a Noble Lord, without whoſe Favour perhaps <hi>Holbein</hi> might have ſpent his whole life in miſery, and alwaies lain hid in Obſcurity. Others affirm that he did not paſs into <hi>England</hi> till a long while after, with a Deſign to get ſome Preferment; that he at firſt preſented himſelf to Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> with the Commendatory Letters of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and that he was entertain'd by him with all poſſible demonſtrations of Kindneſs. I have ſeen in the Emperor's Repoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Portraiture which he then made of this Famous Miniſter of State. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that not being able to call to mind the Name of the Ambaſſador, who had promis'd him his Protection, he haſtily made a Draught according to the Idea which he had of his Lineaments, and luckily hit upon the whole Air of his Countenance; ſo that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> immediately knew the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42254:87"/>
Earl of <hi>Arundel;</hi> thus he found at his fingers ends, that which had eſcap'd his Memory. Afterwards theſe two Illuſtrious Patrons made known his Merit to the World, more eſpecially at Court, inſomuch that King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. Honour'd him with his Eſteem and Friendſhip, and expreſs'd himſelf in the moſt obliging Terms in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to a certain Earl, who had made a complaint of him: <hi>I can at my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> (ſaid the King) <hi>Create ſix Earls in in an Hour, but I cannot make one</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bein. I cou'd inſiſt on many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances, but I ſhall only mention one here, which will oblige us to reſume the Diſcourſe concerning <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Holbein</hi> ſaw his Book, that bears the Title of <hi>Encomium Moriae,</hi> or <hi>a Panegyrick upon Folly,</hi> Printed by <hi>Frobenius,</hi> in <hi>Quarto</hi> A. D. 1514. He drew in the Margin certain ſmall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which are all hatch'd with a Pen and make eighty three Pictures; they ſerve as it were for ſo many Illuſtrations
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42254:87"/>
of the Text, and are ſo curiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, that <hi>Holbein</hi>'s Energy might be diſcover'd, even by this ſingle piece of Work. Upon the Margin of the Title of this Book he wrote theſe words: <hi>Hanc</hi> MORIAM <hi>pictam decem diebus ut oblectaretur in eâ</hi> Eraſmus, <hi>habuit. This</hi> Moria <hi>was Painted in ten daies, to the end that</hi> Eraſmus <hi>might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with it. Eraſmus</hi> had a great affection for <hi>Holbein,</hi> neither cou'd he forbear putting himſelf in a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, at the ſight of his Book, which he found ſo well embelliſh'd, and to add very pleaſant Devices to ſome of theſe ſmall Draughts. I took particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice of three, which perhaps may afford ſome Diverſion to Your moſt Serene Highneſs.</p>
               <p>In pag. 53. The Text has it, <hi>Ne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear</hi> Eraſmi <hi>mei Commentaria ſuppilâſſe. Leſt I ſhoud ſeem to play the Plagiary with the Works of my</hi> Eraſmus. <hi>Holbein</hi> places in the Margin <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſitting and writing in a Book upon a Desk, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as he was wont to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42254:88"/>
paint him, and even as he was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by <hi>Albert Durer. Eraſmus</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf drawn, in ſomewhat too good caſe, wrote upon the Book, which was adorn'd with the Figures ADA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIA ERAS: and underneath, <hi>Quum ad hunc locum perveniebat</hi> Eraſmus, <hi>ſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ſic videns exclamavit Ohe, Ohe, ſi</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus <hi>talis eſſet, duceret profecto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. When</hi> Eraſmus <hi>came to this Place, and ſaw himſelf Painted after ſuch a manner, he cry'd out, Heigh ho! if</hi> Eraſmus <hi>were ſo luſty a Fellow, he wou'd certainly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In pag. 54. on the right ſide of theſe words; <hi>Sed multò candidius pinguis ille ac nitidus</hi> Epicuri <hi>de grege porcus: But that fat and ſlick Swine of</hi> Epicurus<hi>'s Heard wou'd appear much more beautiful. Holbein</hi> Painted a jolly young Gallant, ſitting at a well furniſh'd Table; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bottle of Wine, which he held in his left hand; and with his right em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing a Lady of Pleaſure, that ſate by his ſide. But <hi>Eraſmus</hi> wrote under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, HOLBEIN, imagining, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42254:88"/>
his meaning wou'd be very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, even by this ſingle word.</p>
               <p>In the following Page, over againſt theſe words, <hi>Scoti Anima,</hi> Scotus<hi>'s Soul;</hi> the ſame Painter drew an Infant, ſhav'd after the Monaſtick faſhion, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Soul of that Famous Author of Scholaſtick Divinity, with the marks of his Order, which I cannot deſcribe more decently. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> pleaſantly ſubjoyn'd, <hi>Scoti anima cacat ſtulta Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calia:</hi> Scotus<hi>'s Soul cacks Logical Toyes.</hi>

               <p>However, this is not the firſt time that he has been decry'd by all Parties: Thoſe of the Reformed Religion are alſo ſenſible that he did not approve their Innovations, and that he was deſirous of Reformation, of a different nature from theirs. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgive him for writing in his Books: <hi>Poteram in Lutherana factione eſſe Coryphaeus, malui totius Germaniae in

               <p>I have ſomewhat to communicate to Your moſt Serene Highneſs, concerning the Publick Library, in which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42254:90"/>
a vaſt number of Manuſcripts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Printed Books, and it may not be improper here to mention ſome of 'em that occurr to my Memory: The <hi>Greek</hi> Edition of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> in <hi>Quarto,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by <hi>Camerarius.</hi> The Goſpels in <hi>Greek,</hi> with ſquare Letters, Accents, Spirits, Points, and at the bottom of the Pages the Concordance, with the other Goſpels. The Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which are kept at <hi>Oxford,</hi> are almoſt of the ſame Character, but have no Points nor Accents. The Manuſcript of the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Abbey of St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main des Prez,</hi> is conformable to that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> both with reſpect to the Accents and Spirits, which are there to be ſeen, as alſo in regard of the diſpoſition of the Characters, where the <hi>Alpha</hi> has this ſame figure α, the <hi>Epſylon</hi> this ε; nevertheleſs there is no ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Words as in the Manuſcript of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which is apparently above a thouſand years old. There is likewiſe preſerv'd with the higheſt eſteem a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42254:90"/>
Parchment Manuſcript, in <hi>Quarto,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining certain Reaſons, which <hi>Calecas</hi> prepar'd for the <hi>Graecian</hi> Biſhops, who were to be preſent at <hi>Baſil;</hi> in that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, which Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> transfer'd to <hi>Florence,</hi> upon particular Conſiderations. Beſides theſe, there is to be ſeen the Code of the Canons of all the Councils, and of the Fathers, with <hi>Photius</hi>'s <hi>Nomocanon,</hi> and the double Commentary of <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Theodorus Balſamon,</hi> much larger than in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> Edition; for there are alſo compris'd many Reſponſes and conſiderable Pieces of the Patriarchs and Biſhops, which are not to be found elſewhere. All theſe will be publiſh'd in a ſhort time in the Edition, which is now preparing at <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Works of St. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen,</hi> writ in red Characters, and the Commentaries of <hi>Elias Cretenſis,</hi> in black, which were never as yet Printed but in <hi>Latin.</hi> This <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript is extreamly neat, and its Chapters are enrich'd with very fine Miniatures, in which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> is often repreſented
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42254:91"/>
in the Pulpit, Preaching and ſeeming to Diſpute againſt the Hereticks, which are plac'd below on his left Hand, as the Orthodox are on his right; more eſpecially in his Sermon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I likewiſe ſaw an <hi>Alcoran,</hi> very fairly writ on a kind of Oriental Paper, which we know only by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and an admirable Manuſcript <hi>Virgil:</hi> Laſtly there are four Preſſes full of Manuſcripts, the Deſcription of which wou'd rather require a large Volume than a ſingle Letter. I ſhall only add to 'em a Curious Book, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Folio,</hi> a <hi>Joh. Fuſt, Cive Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino, per Petrum de Gernſheim, Anno</hi> 1459. It is the <hi>Officiale Durandi,</hi> which may ſerve to decide the Controverſy between the Nations that lay claim to the Invention of PRINTING. At <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> are to be ſeen the OFFICES OF CICERO, Printed in 1465. but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it bears date ſix years after, the Printed Copy of <hi>Baſil</hi> is more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:42254:91"/>It is alſo requiſite here to take notice of a rare piece of Painting, which is to be ſeen in the Preachers Cloyſter, in which is repreſented that curious Dance of Death, where Perſons of all ſorts of Conditions may find the true Character of Humane Frailty. Emperors, Kings, Princes, Clergy-men and the Rich, may there ſee themſelves lying under an unavoidable neceſſity of dying, as well as the Poor, and thoſe whom we commonly call the moſt miſerable. It is one of the moſt mortifying Spectacles that I know of in Chriſtendom, and tho' it be adorn'd with all the Embelliſhments of Painting, I cou'd never look upon it, without making very pathetical Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon our Mortality. It is expos'd to publick view, and to make it (as it ſeems) yet more publick, the whole Deſign was engrav'd on Copper-prints in the preceeding Age, by a very able Maſter: And indeed this little Book is not unworthy of a Place in a fine Library.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:42254:92"/>If I were oblig'd to ſtay till I had taken a full view of all the Rarities in this City, I ſhou'd never leave it; yet there is one notable Circumſtance, of which I cannot but take ſome notice: In the Arſenal are to be ſeen the Spoils of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> I mean that great Prince (My Lord) whoſe memorable Exploits fill up the whole Hiſtory of that Age; but the <hi>Switzers</hi> made it appear that he was not invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that 'tis very dangerous at the ſame time to make an attempt upon Juſtice and Liberty; of which Truth <hi>Morat</hi> and <hi>Nancy</hi> will be everlaſting Proofs.</p>
               <p>In the Neighbourhood of <hi>Baſil</hi> one may obſerve a thouſand Remarkable Things that depend on the Situation and Nature of the Place: The natural Landskip of the Country thereabouts is a moſt delightful object, and even the Proſpect of <hi>Baſil</hi> along the River, which runs thro' the two Towns is admirable. Is not that part of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where the Salmons go up again from the Sea
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42254:92"/>
to propagate their kind, in like manner very conſiderable? The Seaſon of their arrival is preciſely known, as alſo the time of their abode and that of their departure: The Fiſher-men are ready to take an advantage from this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and are never deceiv'd. The Golden Sands which are found in ſome parts of the adjacent Country, ſufficiently ſhew that there are ſome Mines of Gold, and I cou'd wiſh that they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſcover'd by ſuch Perſons as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be fortunate.</p>

This huge Tun (My Lord) is as Famous as the <hi>Rhodian Coloſſus</hi> was heretofore, which had no greater a quantity of Water between its Leggs, than this contains of Wine within its Cavity. I am apt to believe, that the product of a whole Vintage might be ſtow'd in it; and its compaſs and thickneſs is ſo great, that 'tis requiſite to undertake a Journey to View it all over: For it is twenty one Foot high, thirty one long; and ſufficiently capacious to hold two hundred and twenty ordinary Tuns of Wine.

the foot of the Hill, which retains its ancient name of <hi>Graetzinguen,</hi> from the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who ſerv'd the Emperor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> in that Country. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Inſcription of the above-mention'd Columns, which were made at that time, and even by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Lampridius. This Emperor</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>at his return from the</hi> Levant, <hi>caus'd divers</hi> Arabians, Parthians <hi>and others to be tranſported into the Weſtern Countries, for the ſervice of the War, which he deſign'd to undertake in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.

               <p>It is now (My Lord) time for me to return to my Subject, for I am ſenſible that remote Reflections are not delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Your Highneſs: But I cannot leave <hi>Durlach</hi> without making ſome mention to You of the Learned M. <hi>Keck.</hi> There are few excellent Endowments that may not be juſtly attributed to him, but his profound Learning is moſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42254:99"/>
tranſcendantly conſpicuous: For he has attain'd to a perfect knowledge of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, Antiquity and Hiſtory, has pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated into the moſt abſtruſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, relating to the different Intereſts of Princes and the Law of Nations, is well vers'd in all the liberal Sciences, and ſpeaks ten or twelve ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. Your moſt Serene Highneſs knows that I am not accuſtom'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in Matters of Religion, but I am very ſenſible that M. <hi>Keck</hi> has made a moſt exact ſearch into the niceſt Points, relating to the Controverſies of Chriſtians and the various Sects of Infidels. Theſe are Qualities very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be met with, yet ſuch as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Preſident of Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Eccleſiaſtical Council. If I ſhou'd declare to the World that he is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Poet, I ſhou'd affirm nothing but the truth: In ſhort, he is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Perſonage, and were it not that I call to mind that he is one of my beſt Friends, I ſhou'd add much more in his commendation.</p>

               <p>Within the compaſs of the Citadel,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42254:100"/>
which has been lately built, there is a riſing Ground, ſuppos'd to have been the Tomb of <hi>Druſus:</hi> This Noble <hi>Roman</hi> had put the <hi>Germans</hi> ſo hard to it, that his name became deteſtable even to a Proverb, <hi>Das dich der Drus hole;</hi> never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we read in <hi>Suetonius</hi> that his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral obſequies were ſolemniz'd in the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> and that his dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was carry'd even to <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Shoulders of the moſt eminent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Places thro' which it was convey'd. However, we may get ſome farther light without departing from the Text of this Hiſtorian; in which 'tis obſerv'd that the Legions paid the higheſt Honours to the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that great General; that they abhorr'd even the very Camp where he dy'd, leaving it the infamous name of <hi>Scelerata Caſtra;</hi> that they conſecrated to him the repreſentation of a Tomb, and certain Feſtivals, which were to be celebrated every year in the ſame Place, with combats of Gladiators and Horſe-races; and that they engag'd the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42254:100"/>
ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> to compoſe certain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Prayers upon that ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Hence it may be eaſily concluded that this piece of Antiquity, which has acquir'd ſo much reputation, is only that <hi>Honorarius Tumulus</hi> or Honorary Tomb of which <hi>Suetonius</hi> makes mention.</p>
               <p>I had alſo the ſatisfaction (My Lord) to converſe there with a Perſon in whom I ſaw ſo many rare Qualities, that I ſoon perceiv'd that the publick Fame, which had talkt ſo much of him, had not given me a full narrative of all his Accompliſhments. His extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Merit and ſolid Vertue, which have been equally conſpicuous, both in Proſperity and Adverſity, are not the only Ornaments of his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. The World has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inform'd of the ſhare he has in the management of the principal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Empire, and how much his Counſels are eſteem'd in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court. But 'tis requiſite to take a nearer View of him to obſerve the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Endowments of his Mind, which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42254:101"/>
render him moſt amiable, for a great deal of Generoſity and Courteſy, and every thing that can be imagin'd to be honourable appears in his Conduct and Deportment. It wou'd not be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to declare that I mean the Baron of <hi>Boineburg,</hi> ſince this Character is no leſs peculiar to him than his very Name. His two Daughters have paſs'd into the Noble Families of the Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo Great, but what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from his Son.</p>
               <p>In travelling farther, the Countries afford a moſt delightful Proſpect, and the Towns upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as <hi>Coblentz, Colen, Andernach, Nuys, Weſel, Reez, Emmerick,</hi> &amp;c. which perhaps I remember more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, becauſe I had a ſight of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers curious pieces of Antiquity in thoſe Places, and have even had the good Fortune to recover ſome of 'em. Your Moſt Serene Highneſs will be ſurpriz'd to hear, that the People of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have their Repoſitories of Rarities:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42254:101"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Princes, Noble-men, Divines, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Phyſicians, Hiſtorians, Students, Merchants, and even Artificers.

               <p>But I muſt by no means forget that Famous Vineyard, which produces thoſe moſt delicious Wines, which are ſo highly eſteem'd by Foreigners; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it without Reaſon that</p>

Revenue, which conſtitutes the moſt liquid ſtaple of the <hi>Palatinate. This is that bleſſed ſpot of Ground, which God preſerves as it were the Apple of his Eye;</hi> at leaſt, (My Lord) I only make uſe of the Expreſſion of one of their moſt Famous Preachers.

               <p>Some few Leagues from thence the <hi>Moſelle</hi> empties it ſelf into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> accompany'd with thoſe excellent Vines that grow along its Banks, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes its Streams to the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where theſe ſorts of Wines ſerve to furniſh the beſt Tables: Indeed they are not ſo ſtrong as the <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wines, but they ſurpaſs 'em in the deliciouſneſs
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42254:102"/>
of their Taſte. I preſume to diſcourſe to You (My Lord) about Matters in which You cannot but be much better Skill'd than myſelf; for altho' Your Highneſs makes only a very good uſe of the beſt Wines, yet I have very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerv'd You to take delight in hearing a true Eſtimate and Judgment made of 'em by others. If this may paſs for a Repetition, 'tis ſo much the more tolerable, becauſe 'tis a very ſhort one.</p>
               <p>I ſhou'd have taken greater Delight in the courſe of this Journey, if I had not found <hi>Holland</hi> making great Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for War; for Arms were there taken up on all ſides, upon the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Rupture with <hi>France.</hi> There were then lodg'd ten thouſand Men in <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> for the Defence of the whole Frontier of that Country, and I was preſent at a Review of five thouſand Horſe, that was made at <hi>Weſel: Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick</hi> was likewiſe in a very good Condition.

belong (as Your Highneſs well knows) to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> Theſe Commotions depriv'd me of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities which I waited for to get a farther light in the knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Medals, nevertheleſs I found means to make ſome new Diſcoveries in that Affair, and perhaps another Journey may give me entire ſatisfaction: But this will not happen till the King ſhall have given encouragement to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> by removing their Fears, or to expreſs my ſelf more clearly, till his Intentions ſhall be better known. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Conduct of this great Prince is conformable to the Rules of Equity and Prudence, and the League which he has made with thoſe States is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſo conſiderable Intereſts, that one cannot but hope for its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, at leaſt I wiſh with all my heart that it may be effected.</p>

               <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> is a very ſtately Pile of Building, but that which renders it moſt Famous is, that 'twas built by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that Tradition has preſerv'd its name even to this very day. The neighbouring Plains heretofore ſerv'd as the uſual Theatre of War to the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſo that they who are well vers'd in Hiſtory may call to mind, that <hi>Civilis</hi> was there defeated, and that he cou'd not have avoided falling into the Hands of his Enemies, if he had not provided for his ſafety in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Iſland, in which the place where he made his eſcape is ſtill to be obſerv'd. However the Liberty of the Country wou'd have been ruin'd, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet had appear'd timely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to gain and cover the Paſſages, where the ſcatter'd Forces were poſted in order to rally. <hi>Debellatum eo die foret, ſi Romana Claſſis ſequi mâturaſſet.</hi>

that <hi>Spain</hi> made againſt this Liberty, ſerv'd only to eſtabliſh it with greater Honour and Reputation.

               <p>There is alſo the moſt ingenious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Kerckringius,</hi> who is much more than a very Learned Phyſitian, and has brought the Art of Anatomy to its higheſt pitch of perfection. In his Houſe I clearly diſcern'd every thing that is tranſacted in thoſe Obſcure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, in which the <hi>Foetus</hi> is form'd; for he has ſome of all ſorts of ages and ſizes (if the expreſſion may be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and one may there obſerve with the Order and Proportion, the Progreſs which is daily made from the <hi>Ovum</hi> or Egg to the compleat formation; that is to ſay, from that minute Matter, which is at firſt gather'd together by the Hand of Nature to the abſolute

perfection of an organical and animated Body. One cannot ſufficiently admire thoſe little <hi>Skeletons</hi> of Fleſh, thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt liquid Bones, and thoſe firſt Draughts of a Humane Body: They are ſo many Myſteries unvail'd, which leave great light in the Mind, and ſo many ſubjects for the fineſt Reflection's in the World.

               <p>So great <hi>Idea</hi>'s of this City have been every where form'd, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be ſaid of it, is alwaies too little. Your Moſt Serene Highneſs well knows that it is the Seat of Opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and the Rendezvous of Riches: that with reſpect to its ſituation; its extent; its more than ſtately Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; its Canal which divides it on all ſides; and that loftineſs, which cannot be expreſs'd and which is its true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, it ſhows more Grandeur and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42254:110"/>
Magnificence even than the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful City of <hi>Rome;</hi> neither do I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire (My Lord) at ſuch an occurrence; ſince it has extended its Commerce, much farther than the other ever did its Conqueſts. Again, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> has diſcover'd two Worlds to enrich it ſelf, whereas <hi>Rome</hi> was content with the ſpoils of one. It is a very pompous Spectacle, to behold in its Ports and Canals thoſe numerous Fleets that come to People the Town. Sometimes they are ſeen there to the number of ten thouſand Veſſels, that is to ſay, another <hi>Amſterdam</hi> upon the Water; or rather a floating Province, of which <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> is the Capital City. To ſee the Arrival of ſo vaſt a multitude of Ships and ſo prodigious a Reſort of People, a man wou'd fancy himſelf to be preſent at the General Fair of the Univerſe. This Imagination (I confeſs) is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what odd; But what can one ſay of a City, in which there is a Concourſe of ſo many different Nations; where ſo great Wealth is expos'd to view; where
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42254:111"/>
is to be ſeen at once every thing that the Fruitfulneſs of the <hi>Indies</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in a courſe of many years; and to ſpeak more clearly, where a view may be taken of the Store-Houſes of all the rich Harveſts of the <hi>Levant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Town-Houſe</hi> is a Noble Pile of Building; its Architecture being the moſt magnificent and the moſt regular in the World. It was erected by Art, within a little ſpace of time, at the expence of thirty millions, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dimenſions and form of it are repreſented in Prints, which are very much eſteem'd. Private Perſons in this City are very Rich, and there are ſome who wou'd be judg'd to be ſo, even in the opinion of <hi>Craſſus:</hi> I alſo know one who ſent ſo powerful a ſupply to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as was ſufficient to reſcue him from the violent Attacks of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Their manner of counting is extraordinary, and ſomewhat more ſtately than that of reckoning by Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in the firſt Empires; ſo that to hear 'em talk of dividing Gold by Tuns,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42254:111"/>
wou'd put Your Highneſs in mind of the <hi>Triumvirs</hi> who made only three parts of the World. At <hi>Amſterdam</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one chooſes a Creed at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Religion is as free as the State; nay even the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick does not offend their Conſciences, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it interferrs with their Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the publick Exerciſe of that alone is prohibited.</p>
               <p>I had a ſight of all their Curioſities and thoſe of all ſorts, and among others divers Paintings that we know, and others which are unknown to us; as alſo <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Chineſe</hi> Pieces of an ineſtimable value. In theſe laſt, a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eye may diſcover all the ſecret particulars of the Hiſtory; the manner of living; Cuſtoms and Religion of thoſe Countries, and there are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented certain Martyrs, who ſacrifice their Blood to the tranſport of their Zeal, if it may be allow'd to make ſo bad an application of that ſacred name, which belongs only to the Heroes of the true Religion. For the Effuſion of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42254:112"/>
Blood and even Death it ſelf are only the exteriour Decorations of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the proper place of its Sacrifice is the Heart and the Will, where it has Faith for its Object.</p>
               <p>As for the other Curioſities, they are ſo numerous, that they may even be reckon'd by Tuns as well as their Gold. Among others there are four Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Repoſitories, in which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd as many Rarities as I ever ſaw elſewhere. M. <hi>de Witzen</hi> Recorder of the City, is Maſter of the firſt of theſe, and it ſeems as if his Houſe were built leſs for an Habitation, than to delight the Eyes; nothing being to be found in any part of it but Magnificence and Symmetry; neither can it be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd whether the Repoſitory ſerves as an Ornament to the Houſe, or the Houſe to the Repoſitory. For there are choice Collections of Paintings, Books, Images and the fineſt pieces of Antiquity; inſomuch that it may be affirm'd, that that which is ſcarce eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where elſe, is here found abundance.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42254:112"/>
M. <hi>Vander Hem</hi> and M. <hi>Occo</hi> Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, have in like manner each of 'em their particular <hi>Muſoeum,</hi> and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon cannot be made between 'em, becauſe their value cannot be known. A Man may imagine that he has taken a view of every thing when he has ſeen but one, and yet in the other he meets with a Multitude of new Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; ſo that it does not ſeem as if he paſs'd out of one Repoſitory into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but out of one World into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The fourth Repoſitory is in the poſſeſſion of M. <hi>Gril,</hi> and I have caus'd Draughts to be taken from the beſt of the Medals which are there preſerv'd: But thoſe ſorts of Rarities are unknown to many Perſons, and I ſhall keep 'em entire for the uſe of Your Moſt Serene Highneſs.</p>
               <p>In another Place I ſaw certain Charts of an extraordinary importance, which diſcover all the ſecrets of Navigation: They are the lively Images of the Sea, and the bottom of its Channel is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as exactly repreſented, as if it were
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42254:113"/>
from the drie Land. The Shelves, Quick-ſands, Rocks, Streights and Channels are all expreſs'd upon theſe Draughts; inſomuch that without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attain'd to the skill of an able Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote, one might by the help of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions trace out the Roads from one Pole to the other. But the publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt takes no notice of theſe Oracles which Experience has utter'd from time to time, but even ſuffers 'em to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in Oblivion.</p>

            <p>IT is a very great Honour to me that Your Moſt Serene Highneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends ſo far as to be mindful of me, and that too with ſignal marks of Magnificence; that my Deſires are prevented; that I am loaded with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and that Your Highneſs has thought fit to attribute to the ſingle Opinion you have conceiv'd of me,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42254:117"/>
what might well ſerve as a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for an extraordinary Merit and for much more conſiderable Services. I cannot but be ſurpriz'd at it, I confeſs, and not daring to penetrate into the depth of Your Judgment, am conſtrain'd to ſet a greater value upon myſelf, notwithſtanding the vanity of ſuch Thoughts. Indeed (My Lord) 'tis to partake of ſomewhat of that exquiſit diſcerning Faculty, to know how to eſteem You, as I do: The Luſtre of Grandeur is apt to dazzle common Eyes, but does not alwaies cauſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in thoſe that have been well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd: For neither that Highneſs of Birth, nor that Illuſtrious Rank which Your Moſt Serene Highneſs holds in the Empire, is capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding my Attention; ſo many rare Endowments, ſo many Divine Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters imprinted on Your Noble Mind, are the only Charms that attract my Eyes: And this Proſpect (My Lord) being alwaies fixt upon the moſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Points of Antiquity, does not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42254:117"/>
ceaſe to have a particular regard to to Your admirable Perfections. I cou'd even preſume to avouch, that I have diſcern'd in Your Perſon more excellent Qualities than I have ever read of; but I ſhall not enlarge any farther upon this copious Theme.</p>
            <p>Your Highneſs is a Lover of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: How fortunate is the Deſtiny! how happy is the Inclination! that a Prince ſhou'd be induc'd to recreate himſelf ſo pleaſantly, and that that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of Leiſure which happens after the Tranſaction of the moſt important Affairs of State, ſhou'd refine his Mind and augment its Vigour: For theſe ſorts of Studies ſerve to divert without amuſing, and to employ without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining; alwaies retaining the Animal Spirits in a convenient Elevation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſturbance, and in Activity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Fatigues. <hi>Curioſity</hi> is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Employment of Heroes, but more eſpecially that of Medals: Theſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Monuments, theſe little Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of the Memory of illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42254:118"/>
theſe ſacred Pledges of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Glory, ſhew us the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Antiquity, and diſcover 'em in their innate ſimplicity; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they may be ſeen as they really are in their entire, Luſtre and Perfection. They are properly ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pieces of Metal, animated as it were with a ſecret Life that does not take its riſe from the Work-man; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from I know not what Energy communicated from the incomparable Originals to their Images. This is not the Thing it ſelf but the Quinteſſence of it, neither is it a repreſentation of the Man but of the Demi-God. What delight is there (My Lord) in taking an Eſtimate of Your Qualities from thoſe great Examples which ſeem as yet to have an influence over their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies; to judge of them by You, and to obſerve in them that which You find in Yourſelf? To diſcover at firſt ſight that all Ages have had their Heroes; and if ſome have been more renowned than others, 'tis becauſe the Occaſions
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42254:118"/>
were more opportune, and not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that their Endowments were not equally conſpicuous.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory ſupplies us with a Relation of paſt Occurrences and produces the particular circumſtances of Time, but the exact Truth and the niceſt Points are often wanting; or the manner of Expreſſion does not furniſh us with a true <hi>Idea</hi> of the nature of the Things, as they appear in the Medal. This is not a proper Place to diſcourſe of every Particular that we know on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but give me leave (My Lord) to declare, that I have not met with ſo many Ingenious Lovers of Curioſity elſewhere as in <hi>Germany.</hi> This part of <hi>Europe,</hi> which has peopl'd all the others, has reſerv'd the beſt Treaſures to it ſelf; ſo that it may well be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that the reſt is only the Refuſe, and in the compariſon we ſhall alwaies find a very great inequality. It is true indeed that there are ſome more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable People, whoſe Manners are more polite, and that wou'd have the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42254:119"/>
advantage if they were ſeen only once or twice, ſo that it ſeems as if their ſtudy'd Regularity ſerv'd only to cover their Deformities, and perhaps Your Moſt Serene Highneſs may have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made this Reflection that even where no ſolid Judgment is to be found, there appears a kind of modiſh Air or affected Gallantry, which dazzles the Eyes; at leaſt I have often obſerv'd it in <hi>France.</hi> Again, where no ſenſe of Honour nor real Generoſity is to be met with, there is a ſtudious affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Civil Carriage, and a certain number of Cadences which ſeem to ſupply the defect, and to afford ſome ſatisfaction but are really nothing leſs than Vertue. The <hi>Germans</hi> (My Lord) are more Grave and naturally endu'd with a great deal of Solidity: They are what they appear to be, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they do not appear at firſt ſight altogether as they are, much Skill or at leaſt Application is requiſite, to diſcover their Merit. Among them more eſpecially, good Nature and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie

are in their natural Purity, and their Integrity of manners is altogether plain without any adulterate mixture or diſguiſe; which is every where the Character of a generous and free Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that cannot endure Affectation. Theſe People are ready to perform whatever they undertake in good earneſt, without putting themſelves to any trouble to find out agreeable and ſpecious manners of ſetting about the Work; ſo that a Man may ſoon know when they bear good will toward him and when not: In ſhort, to make uſe of the Terms of one of our Miniſters of State: <hi>The Heart never appears there in Maſcarade, but Sincerity and Candour are the diſtinguiſhing Marks of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Tacitus</hi> had declar'd as much ſixteen hundred years ago, <hi>Nullos mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talium armis aut fide ante</hi> Germanos <hi>eſſe.</hi> i. e. <hi>None ever ſurpaſs'd the</hi> Germans <hi>in Valour and Fidelity.</hi>

            <p>It is of no great importance to know, whether the Love of Curioſity be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among 'em, upon account of that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42254:120"/>
natural Inclination they have for Truth, which is diſcover'd in it as it were in its ſource; or by reaſon of that ſeverity of Temper, which of all the Divertiſements of the Mind, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces 'em to make choice of the nobleſt and moſt profitable. However, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Curioſity is moſt honour'd and ſought for by the beſt means in thoſe Parts, and I have every where found this Diſpoſition predominant. I ſhall here ſubjoyn ſome Diſcoveries which have been made by me in my laſt Journey, which Gratitude obliges me to conſecrate to Your Moſt Serene Highneſs, not being able at preſent to do any of greater moment for Your Service.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin then with <hi>Kniebis</hi> in <hi>Schwaben.</hi> What a prodigious Mountain is this (My Lord)! Its vaſt height, which leaves the Clouds far below it, and ſet my Feet almoſt in Heaven, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd me leſs than the two Seaſons, which I ſaw there at the ſame time, and at the diſtance only of four Paces
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42254:120"/>
one from another, that is to ſay, Heat and Cold met together, which every where elſe make ſo great a noiſe over our Heads; the Reaſon (as they ſay) is, becauſe they cannot agree in a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral Country, but altho' they be neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yet if each be detain'd in its reſpective Region, nothing is more quiet and calm. If this Obſervation in Natural Philoſophy be true, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to referr myſelf to it; however, I very well remember that I was frozen and broil'd within a Moment without hearing any ſuch Noiſe.</p>
            <p>I left the Prodigy ſoon after, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to paſs to <hi>Wirtemberg.</hi> The Hills thereabouts appear'd to me the fineſt and moſt delightful in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether beſet with Vine-yard Plots and Corn-fields. Theſe plentiful Crops by I know not what Diſpoſition caus'd by the ſituation of the Country, form a moſt pleaſant Land-skip on all ſides, and a kind of Regularity which is extreamly ſurprizing. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are very ſociable; perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42254:121"/>
they are ſupply'd with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conveniences. Thus a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodation at home naturally inſpires us with ſentiments of Civility toward Strangers, but theſe People owe part of this Domeſtick happineſs to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of their Prince, ſo that one cannot caſt an Eye upon 'em, without every were perceiving the marks of the Gentleneſs of his Government. Power and Authority are only exerted in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Diſcipline, and this is the only uſe that is there made of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; ſo that I am apt to believe, nothing more is needful for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of his Memory. How difficult it is to uſe abſolute Power with ſo much moderation; and what a degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Magnanimity (My Lord) is requiſite to attempt nothing when one is in capacity of doing every thing, and to maintain the exerciſe of ſo many Vertues amidſt all the bad Examples of the degenerate Age! I ſhall ſtop here without extending my Reflection any farther, which wou'd be too hard

There are divers Maſters, not only endu'd with ſingular Abilities, but alſo with all manner of Politeneſs and Courteſie, ſo that the Scholars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 'em ſoon make a conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in all the parts of Humane Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. Their Tables are not only plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully furniſh'd with all ſorts of neceſſary Proviſions, but even with Dainties: The Diviſion of Time is ſo well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42254:122"/>
that that exact diſtribution of Hours for every particular Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, formes a ſettl'd Cuſtom, which becomes very agreeable to the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Students; inſomuch that it appears leſs to be a regular Diſcipline than a well order'd Liberty. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that every thing is eſtabliſh'd upon a Noble Foundation, none but Perſons of the higheſt Quality can be admitted into that College; neither is there any Mixture allow'd. For 'tis alledg'd that in that tender Age a mean Air wou'd prove contagious, and thoſe marks of Diſtinction which inſpire 'em with a ſence of their good Fortune, afterward induces 'em to aſſume that Majeſtick Air, which ought to be the Character of their high Station. Thus (My Lord) without running into the common Road amidſt the Crowd of ignoble and vulgar People, they attain to the moſt abſolute Accompliſhments, and paſs over with the ſame ſteps to the Court, and to the moſt Honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments either in Church or State; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

M. <hi>de Merlay,</hi> who is de Chief Governour, as alſo M. <hi>May</hi> and M. <hi>Cramer</hi> Profeſſors, are Perſons of extraordinary Merit, and no ſmall Ornaments to the College. I ſhall alwaies lye under an Obligation even during my whole Life to His Moſt Serene Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> for permitting me to reſide there for ſometime, and to take notice at my leaſure of this curious manner of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42254:123"/>
ſhou'd never proceed from my Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: His Highneſs was pleas'd to give me leave to augment his Treaſure with ſome Medals that I had brought. The fine Place where they are depoſited and the good company that they enjoy is ſufficient to take away any regret they might have for the loſs of their firſt Maſter: And indeed, I am much better pleas'd to ſee 'em in ſo Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hands than in my own. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs often viſits 'em, and I doubt not, but that his Inclination attracts (as I may ſo ſay) the greater part of His Moſt Serene Family.

of my Invention. His moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Highneſs Duke <hi>Frederick</hi> takes as much delight in it as it deſerves, and often diverts himſelf there with much ſatisfaction. I have been told that the Dutcheſs has a favourable regard to thoſe that afford her theſe pleaſant Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that She was not offended at my Viſits. Perhaps alſo She may be ſomewhat addicted to Curioſity, and that being Siſter to Your Moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Highneſs, Her Inclination may lead her to ſuch kind of Divertiſements; however, if She be not curious in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, She is ſo at leaſt in Jewels. I have ſeen in Her Appartment a precious Cheſt, that weighs more than myſelf, in which is contain'd nothing but Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Emeralds and Pearls. This is a very rare ſort of Curioſity, but 'tis not expos'd to the view of all manner of Perſons. For altho' 'tis capable of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording an Univerſal Delight, and is admir'd as well by the Ignorant as by the Learned and Ingenious; yet 'tis eſteem'd as a very great Privilege to get
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42254:124"/>
a ſight of it. To conclude, nothing is here wanting, either with reſpect to Nobility, Ingenuity, Curioſity, Riches or even Happineſs it ſelf. I ſhou'd have ſeen at</p>

               <p>A City that has acquir'd ſo great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and deſerves as much. Which of theſe two (My Lord) wou'd Your Highneſs think fit to preferr <hi>Noremberg</hi> or <hi>Augsburg?</hi> Indeed they both bear away the Bell from the other Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> in regard of their Beauty, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Neatneſs, Concourſe of People, and the Magnificence of their Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Marqueſs of <hi>Durlach,</hi> to whom they are both well known, finds
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42254:124"/>
                  <hi>Augsburg</hi> more ſtately in ſome Places, but declares at the ſame time that <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg</hi> is all over Beautiful. I obſerv'd it to be well ſituated and full of civiliz'd People, but that which afforded me greater ſatisfaction is, that Curioſity is there very much in vogue, that it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the place of Neatneſs and Elegancy, being not only ſufficiently known, but alſo highly eſteem'd among the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. I ſaw in the Houſe of M. <hi>de Viatis</hi> an infinite number of Rarities, and every thing that is proper to be admitted into the <hi>Muſoeum</hi> or Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of an Ingenious Antiquary, <hi>viz.</hi> Books, Paintings, Medals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But his Eagerneſs, tranſport of Paſſion, Frenzy or whatever elſe you pleaſe to call it, is much to be admir'd in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that is to ſay, in heaping up a prodigious Maſs of Arms, which are more eſpecially remarkable, either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of the Work-manſhip or for ſome notable Hiſtorical Circumſtance. He ſhew'd me the Sword that put <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Barnveldt</hi> to ſilence, and in that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42254:125"/>
point did more than even the whole Power of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was able to effect. And indeed, the very ſight of it wou'd be ſufficient to affright the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Oratour. He alſo preſented to my view that which was employ'd in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off ſo many Heads at <hi>Prague</hi> during the Rebellion, and the Partizan which pierc'd the Body of <hi>Walſtein</hi> at <hi>Agria.</hi> This laſt Weapon attracted my Eyes, and oblig'd me to make ſome Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Deſtiny of this formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Favourite; who cou'd have imagin'd that ſo firm a ſettlement of Grandeur, ſo great Authority and Power cou'd be ſo ſuddenly quaſh'd with ſo very little difficulty! The whole World was in expectation of the event of his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes; the Empire trembl'd at his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and Foreigners were ready to ground upon his Deſigns the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of all their Affairs: In a word, preparations were making even to change the very frame of the Univerſe, when a blow given by a pitiful Fellow caſt him to the Ground, and there was
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42254:125"/>
no longer any talk of this great Man.</p>
               <p>There are alſo to be ſeen the Arms of the moſt Potent Princes of the laſt Age: I know not whether it were a turn of my Imagination; but it ſeem'd to me (My Lord) as if that ſparkling Luſtre which darted forth on all ſides, was leſs the brightneſs of the Metal than the Reflection of ſo many fierce Blows and Heroical Atchievments. Indeed there is nothing that imprints a more lively <hi>Idea</hi> on the Mind than theſe ſorts of Objects; but perhaps the Difficulty that there is in gathering together ſuch precious ſpoils, hinders the Curioſity from being ſo common.</p>
               <p>As for the Medals, there are not very many of the firſt rank, but others are to be met with almoſt every where, and in the Hands of all ſorts of Perſons; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Love of Curioſity has made the Collection; or whether Wealth which alwaies brings along with it whatever is moſt precious, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd 'em thither. However, M. <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kamer</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42254:126"/>
enjoys a better ſhare of 'em than others, and Your Highneſs may Judge of it by this Pattern, being a Golden <hi>Julio</hi> with the reverſe of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which I have obtain'd by his Liberality. He is a very able Phyſician, and endow'd with all thoſe excellent Qualities that procure Eſteem and Reputation. I might alſo aſſociate with him M. <hi>Noberlein</hi> an Apothecary of more than ordinary Parts, who has a Library and a Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory, and whoſe perſonal Endowments ſet him above all thoſe whom I know of his Profeſſion: I receiv'd from him that curious Golden Medal of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> which has this Inſcription: VIC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR OMNIUM GENTIUM.</p>
               <p>There are many Learned Men in this City; Antiquity, Hiſtory, Politicks, Eloquence, and the Mechanical Arts are there in a flouriſhing State. Much time might be ſpent in entertaining Your Moſt Serene Highneſs, if I ſhou'd go about to call to mind every thing that might be ſaid upon this Subject. I ſhall only add one word concerning
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42254:126"/>
M. <hi>Grundler,</hi> a Monk, who (as he ſaies) had lately embrac'd the Reform'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Luther:</hi> But to juſtifie to me the change of his opinion it wou'd be requiſite for him to have as much command over Men's Reaſon, as he has over their Eyes, to which he repreſents what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thinks fit, and in any manner whatever at his pleaſure; for he is abſolutely Maſter of the moſt abſtruſe Secrets in Opticks. This is that Art (My Lord) which is capable of fixing half the World in a Point, and which has found out means to extract viſual Repercuſſions out of Chryſtal, and to draw near the moſt remote Objects by certain Re-productions of <hi>Species</hi> and Correſpondences of Proſpects, which are extended in the moſt limited ſpaces from the Diſtances as far as the Eye can reach. In ſhort, 'tis that fallicious Art that deceives our Sight, and which with the Rule and Compaſs diſorders all our Sences. But our Artiſt proceeds yet farther; for he can even remove
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42254:127"/>
Ghoſts from their Stations at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without any aſſiſtance from the Infernal Regions. Some mention has been already made to Your Moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Highneſs of that Sphoerical Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, which receives the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of remote Objects thro' a ſmall Thread of light, and which rolling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the dark, imprints 'em on it, and cauſes 'em to follow its Motion; ſo that real Phantoms and Ghoſts are now no longer ſenſible of the other World. I know divers Perſons of great courage who have chang'd pale at the ſight of theſe Sports and of theſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Artifices.</p>
               <p>And with M. <hi>Grundler</hi>'s good leave, all the Eſteem that I had of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Learning, was not able to free me from that Dread which ſeiz'd upon my Spirits on that occaſion; inſomuch that I was apt to believe that there never was in the World a greater Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitian than he: For it ſeem'd to me as if I had a ſight of Paradiſe, of Hell and of wand'ring Spirits and Phantoms, ſo

that altho' I know myſelf to be endu'd with ſome meaſure of Reſoluteneſs, yet at that time I wou'd willingly have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one half to ſave the other: All theſe Apparitions ſuddenly diſappear'd and gave place to Shews of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For in a moment, I ſaw the Air fill'd with all ſorts of Birds, almoſt after the ſame manner as they are uſually painted round about <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and in the twinkling of an Eye, a Country-Wedding appear'd to my view, with ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Altho' private Perſons are very rich at <hi>Noremberg;</hi> yet it may be affirm'd that the State is infinitely more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent. This is what I have obſerv d in the Republicks which I have ſeen, and is a Quality eſſential for their Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Arſenal</hi> of this City is very well furniſh'd, and capable of affording Arms to nine or ten thouſand Men at an inſtant: The Court is a moſt noble Pile of Building, adorn'd with a vaſt quantity of valuable Paintings, among which that of this great Duke deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly holds the firſt Rank; and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which is ſuppos'd to have been built in the time of <hi>Druſus,</hi> anſwers well the reputation of its Antiquity. From the beſt Quarter, which ſerves upon occaſion as an Appartment for the Emperours, the whole City may be diſcover'd, and (if one may be allow'd to ſay ſo) an entirely perfect <hi>Horizon:</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:42254:128"/>
For there is nothing in the adjacent Plains to bound the ſight, and the weakneſs of the Eye only hinders it from taking a farther Proſpect. One may judge of the Height of this Place by the Detpth of its Well; which is ſo great that a very long Story may be told during the time that a Stone is thrown into it e're the noiſe of its fall be heard: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that this Interval is ſurprizing, and I doubt whether that Well of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ſo much celebrated in ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and Modern Narratives, deſerves more Conſideration; at leaſt I have no mind to go thither to take the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it, on purpoſe to make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. I ſaw in the Houſe of a private Cityzen thoſe curious Brazen Figures which the Magiſtrates had caus'd to be caſt, to adorn the Fountain of the great Market-Place: certainly this muſt needs have been the Work-manſhip of the Gods and not of Men, or at leaſt theſe Statues were made by Giants: For that of <hi>Neptune</hi> weighing three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and three hundred Pounds, is alone
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42254:129"/>
ſufficient to brain more people than all the Giants of the Fable, and 'tis in my opinion one of the fineſt Maſter-pieces of the Age:</p>
               <p>The publick Library after thoſe of the Emperour and the King is the fineſt that I have ſeen; for the Manuſcripts and Miniatures very much ſurpaſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and its ſmall Embelliſhments render it more delightful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: They are the Portraitures of Learned Men, divers Skeletons of many different Animals, and ſome of thoſe Natural Curioſities, which elevate the Mind at the ſame time as they inſtruct it. The Ingenious M. <hi>Wolkamer</hi> has furniſh'd this Library with part of theſe Rarities, and left an Example worthy to be imitated by others. I receiv'd Information here of the Honour that the Senate had done me in making a Preſent to me of certain Medals, which they had ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> for my uſe; whereupon I was overjoy'd and ready to make all manner of Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſo great a favour, altho' I had

               <p>The Caſtle in which his Electoral Highneſs reſides, is a very ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and its Architecture ſhews a kind of Majeſtick Air; but the modern Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings joyn'd to it are moſt commodious.

to be view'd by all ingenious Lovers of Curioſity. His Electoral Highneſs, who is entirely addicted to the adminiſtration of the Government does not ceaſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to allow ſome time for the compleating of this Collection. One wou'd ſcarce imagine how great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs he has made in the Work, only within his own Territories about <hi>Weſel, Santen</hi> and <hi>Cleves,</hi> where a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of theſe Medals has been found, and (what is moſt important) even of thoſe that are very rare: That of <hi>Cornuficius</hi> is of this number, than which I never ſaw a finer, but I ſhall not here produce a particular Deſcription of any of 'em: I have <hi>Memorandum's</hi> of thoſe that are moſt valuable, and theſe Notes are as good luck wou'd have it, very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; nay I have even delineated with a Pen thoſe that I judg'd to be ſingular: But they were ſo numerous, that I was oblig'd another day to deſire leave to employ myſelf in the ſame Work: I remember that I ſpent the ſecond time

five or ſix hours in the enjoyment of this agreeable Diverſion, and that I very much enrich'd my Manuſcripts with thoſe Rarities; But altho' I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd only the tenth part of 'em, yet I ſhou'd have thought my Journey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to very good purpoſe. The cuſtody of theſe choice Treaſures is committed to M. <hi>Heimhach,</hi> who is a very great Admirer of 'em, and I doubt not but that he contributes, as far as his utmoſt Abilities will admit, to the ſatisfaction of which the Elector his Maſter is deſirous in theſe Matters.

He did me the Honour once to tell me, that he took great delight in this Employment, and that he wou'd ſpend more time in it, as ſoon as the more important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State cou'd allow him ſo much leaſure. However, (My Lord) the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

In this Conjuncture all <hi>Europe</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Electoral Highneſs's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; it was alſo well known that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did not hope for a more potent nor more ready Protector, and that the Aſſiſtance he afforded 'em; was ſufficient to prevent, or at leaſt to deferr their Ruin. His memorable Actions perform'd not long ſince, have gain'd him ſo great renown in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> that his very name alone is capable of ſupporting the Intereſt of that Party which he ſhall think fit to favour. In a word, he is a Prince of an admirable <hi>Genius,</hi> inſomuch that I never ſaw any Man that had not a reſpect for his Perſon, and as for my own part, I muſt acknowledge that my Affections toward him are moſt cordial and ſincere: But I ought alſo

I was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him in <hi>France</hi> above twenty years ago, and notwithſtanding his youth I eaſily foreſaw his future Merit; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were my expectations deceiv'd in this particular, for his Learning has encreas'd with his Age, and I doubt whether there be any one beſides my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that takes a greater delight in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals than he: This Noble-man has ſpent ſome years in <hi>Italy</hi> and has tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd thro' the whole Continent of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and his profound skill induces me to believe, that he has obſerv'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is neceſſary to be taken

notice of, in order to conſtitute an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, Learned, Judicious and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely accompliſh'd Perſon. I can alſo aſſure Your Highneſs that he is one of the moſt courteous Gentle-men in the World, and I was perſwaded that I ſhou'd have done an injury to the Honourable M. <hi>Seidel,</hi> not to have made this <hi>Parentheſis</hi> in his favour. I know that he is a <hi>Lutheran</hi> and a zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Profeſſour of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but that moſt inviolable Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which has been alwaies between us, and the Conformity of our Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wou'd never ſuffer us to differ tho' never ſo little, about the Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Opinions.</p>
               <p>The two young Princes (My Lord) will be one day great Patrons of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. Their tender Age receives its form from that of the Heroes with whom they daily converſe, and His Electoral Highneſs himſelf is a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Model, from whence they cannot but take very noble <hi>Idea's.</hi> They
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42254:141"/>
have already attain'd to the knowledge of divers Languages, and are very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in all ſorts of Martial Exerciſes, neither are they leſs inſtructed in thoſe Sciences which are capable of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their generous Minds. For their ſeveral Appartments are rather loaded than adorn'd with Books, Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Maps, Chronological Tables, Globes, Sphaeres and Medals. In ſhort, theſe are the Inſtruments that work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by innocently maintaining Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity during Proſperity, and by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it even in Adverſity. It is a general Maxime among the Prudent to be alwaies prepar'd for all manner of Events, as we learn from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> It is very probable that theſe Princes may alwaies ſee For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſmiling and uncapable of doing 'em any injury; but 'tis a much more Royal Praerogative to have Vertue for their familiar Friend and Confident. The Baron de <hi>Swerin</hi> principal Miniſter of State, and a great Patron of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42254:141"/>
has inſpir'd 'em with theſe generous Sentiments, and has done a very ſignal piece of Service to His Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſo well managing the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe two young Princes, and in ſo happily following the Advice of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius Victor;</hi> who writes to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; <hi>Compertum eſt eruditionem, elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam comitatem, praeſertim Principibus neceſſaria eſſe; cùm ſine his naturae bona quaſi incompta aut etiam horrida deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctui ſint.</hi> i. e. <hi>It is certain that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Curioſity and Courteouſneſs are more eſpecially neceſſary in Princes, in regard that without theſe Qualities the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nature wou'd appear as it were unpoliſh'd, if not altogether rude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</hi>

               <p>I there ſaw the Royal Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> marry'd to the Electoral Prince, who (as they ſay) takes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Delight in theſe Walks than in any other Divertiſements. The Wines of the neighbouring Country are moſt delicious, and the Beer there brewd is as good as in any part of <hi>Germany.</hi> There is alſo more variety of Game than in any Place in the World, which every where cauſes good cheer and plentiful Entertainments. I am very much oblig'd to Doctor <hi>Schubart,</hi> in whoſe Houſe I lodg'd, upon this very account, as alſo for giving me a ſight of the moſt remarkable Curioſities in the City of <hi>Dreſden.</hi> I wou'd willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make no mention of 'em at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſenſible that the moſt part of what I have to ſay as to theſe Matters is already known, and that I am not capable of expreſſing my ſelf ſufficiently
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42254:142"/>
in their commendation. This City is very Beautiful, Strong and Rich, not to add, that 'tis adorn'd, fortify'd and enrich'd more and more every day, and I have lately perus'd an advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſcription of it in a Book that bears the Title of <hi>L'Europe Vivante,</hi> but I am not inclin'd to make Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Palace contains a World of Wonders, a Liſt of which has been printed, but they are not all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended therein. Seven ſpacious Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are fill'd with the richeſt Jewels that Your Highneſs can poſſibly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, with a prodigious quantity of Veſſels of Rock-Chryſtal, Coral and precious Stones, beſides curious Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings drawn by <hi>Albert Durer, Titian, Lucas Leydenſis, Lucas Cranis, Rubens</hi> and many other excellent Maſters. I ſaw there the Life of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> repreſented by the firſt of thoſe Hands, which was carv'd in Wood, and a large piece of the real Croſs upon which our Saviour was crucify'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:42254:143"/>One may there alſo obſerve with much delight the Mechanical Works of divers Princes, and 'tis admirable (My Lord) to behold what Art can produce when exercis'd by ſo noble Hands. Therc is perhaps a greater number of <hi>Automata</hi> than in any other place in the World, and thoſe too ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, rich and ſurprizing. I ſhou'd have ſpent much longer time in the Examination of 'em, were it not that my Mind was taken up with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Medals which preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to my View. M. <hi>Beurel,</hi> to whoſe care they are committed, will e're long applie himſelf to theſe kinds of Studies, ſo that I doubt not but that he will find ſufficient Employment in delineating a conſiderable number of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ones which are there preſerv'd, and in placing 'em in a more regular Order. I cou'd not get a ſight of a little Cheſt of old Gold, becauſe 'tis kept in the private Cloſet of His Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who was then abſent from <hi>Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:42254:143"/>
and came not thither during the whole time of my abode in the Town, but only to lie there one Night. This rich Treaſure is very highly valu'd and 'tis probable, that I ſhou'd have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd it no leſs if I had had the good fortune of ſeeing it. Indeed 'twas no fault of the Barons de <hi>Frizen</hi> who have there the moſt honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as the chiefeſt Merit; but as I have already declar'd, the Prince's Abſence alone depriv'd me of that ſatisfaction, which I might have otherwiſe had. However, I determine to return thither once more on purpoſe, and the Delight that I alwaies take in the viewing of Medals is ſo great, as to oblige me to reſolve upon this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; neither have I any regard to the loſs of time or Expences, whenever I find an opportunity to enrich my Mind with new Diſcoveries: I ſhall then have ſeen the Repoſitories of five Secular Electoral Princes, and perhaps none has ſo great an inſight as myſelf

perhaps does <hi>Africa</hi> produce ſo great a number of Monſters. The Elector who delights in this Curioſity, caus'd 'em to be tranſported thither, both from the Eaſtern and Weſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but the moſt part of 'em come out of his own Territories. There is not finer Hunting in the World than hereabouts, ſo that ſometimes above a thouſand wild Bores are deſtroy'd in one Day.

ſo jealous were thoſe ancient Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, leſt their Liberty ſhou'd one day be invaded by ſo ingenious a Perſon, who having found out the knack of doing whatever he liſted with ſavage Beaſts, might be induc'd with much greater reaſon to turn the Hearts of his Fellow-Cityzens, ſo as to make 'em comply with his deſires.</p>

I was told that I ought not to be ſurpriz'd at its vaſt extent, in regard that it conſiſted in ſeven different Towns, but this ſerv'd only to encreaſe the Wonder, for I ſhou'd have judg'd that it contain'd above a hundred. It is altogether as broad as the City of <hi>London</hi> is long, and the number of the Inhabitants is proportionable to its compaſs. If the thirteen hundred Apothecaries of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> are a ſufficient Evidence of its Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſs, the two thouſand Jeſuits of <hi>Prague</hi> may be cited to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: The other Religious Societies are alſo as numerous as in any part
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42254:148"/>
of the World whatever, and there are ſome Monaſteries that reſemble the Palaces of Princes rather than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring Places of Perſons who profeſs to renounce all the Vanities of the World. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a Church in this City and conſequently a Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the Title of <hi>Pilgrims of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus,</hi> but I never heard any mention made of that name any where elſe. The People are very devout; yet I do not think myſelf oblig'd to believe every thing that their miſtaken zeal ſuggeſts to 'em. They ſhew'd me in a Church the three Stones of a Pillar, which the Devil (as they ſay) had brought from <hi>Rome</hi> to deceive a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prieſt as he was celebrating Maſs, with whom he had made a Compact: They added that St. <hi>Peter</hi> threw this Fiend and his Pillar three ſeveral times into the Sea, and that this Balk having ſpoil'd all his Meaſures, he was ſo much enrag'd, that he broke his Pillar for vexation, and nevertheleſs too fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately

I thought to have got off by ſaying, that I had never read nor ſo much as heard of it before, altho' I had been tolerably well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Miracles; but that perhaps the circumſtance of Time might afford me ſome light into the matter: Therefore I demanded of 'em when this happen'd; they anſwer'd many thouſand years ago: I reply'd that the Chriſtian Religion was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd only ſixteen hundred years ago that is to ſay, ſince the Nativity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> It is true (ſaid they) but the Miracle which we have mention'd to you is a great deal older than that: Thus my Chronologie being entirely ſubverted, I was almoſt forc'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Catholick Church, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the Maſs were much more ancient than they were ſuppos'd to be.</p>

or Moſque, ſuppos'd to have been built by the <hi>Turks</hi> when they carry'd on their Incurſions even to thoſe Parts: It is altogether different from ours, and receives light only thro' the Roof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt after the ſame manner as the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon</hi> of <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That part of the City, which is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond the River, and commonly call'd the leſſer ſide, is much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, and ſcarce any thing elſe is to be ſeen there but ſumptuous Palaces, which amount to the number of above Three hundred; ſo that this Quarter may well be ſtyl'd the Magazine of the Riches of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and of his Imperial Majeſty's Hereditary Countries. The King's Palace is at preſent that of the Emperor, and, in regard of its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Situation, Architecture, and Ornaments, juſtly deſerves the Title of a Royal Pile of Building. M. <hi>Miſſeroni,</hi> to whoſe Cuſtody the Treaſury is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, gave me a ſight there (without any manner of exaggeration be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42254:150"/>
of the fineſt Paintings in the World: There were above fifty of <hi>Titian,</hi> as alſo a little Room crowded with the Works of <hi>Raphael Angelo,</hi> and four or five ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chambers full of Paintings of the higheſt Value. I cannot call to mind the ſight of ſome empty Rooms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tears in my Eyes, by reaſon that all the Books and Medals were kept in 'em. It is the Property of War to ſpare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and that which none durſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by open Force, was at laſt effected by the Treachery of a private Perſon, who enrich'd Count <hi>Koniſmarck</hi> with theſe Treaſures. I have been inform'd that this General made a Preſent of Part of 'em to Queen <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> and that he caus'd the reſt to be convey'd into a Caſtle which he has in his poſſeſſion near <hi>Bremen.</hi> Indeed it will not be my fault if I have not a ſight of 'em; and I am as likely as any Man to undertake a Journey on purpoſe. If Curioſity has oblig'd me to endure ſo many Toils and Fatigues, it muſt alſo be acknowledg'd
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42254:151"/>
that I have thence receiv'd a great deal of delight and ſatisfaction as a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for my labour. I have there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſome Medals, which are ſuppos'd to be ancient, but I durſt not give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to ſuch an Aſſeveration: I have alſo ſeen ſome at <hi>Paris</hi> that were ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Italy,</hi> and which ſeem'd to me to be of the ſame ſtamp; ſo that 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that there are Counterfeits every where. The above-mention'd M. <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeroni</hi> communicated to me many other choice Rarities, with the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Civility, upon the Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Count <hi>de Lambers</hi> his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty's principal Miniſter of State; to whom I ſhall be oblig'd for this Favour, even during my whole Life.</p>
               <p>It was requiſite once more to viſit <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna;</hi> but before my Arrival there, it may not be improper (my Lord) to give you an account of a ſtrange ſhew that entirely poſſeſs'd my Imagination. As we were paſſing between the River <hi>Elbe,</hi> and a ſmall Wood or Copſe, we
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42254:151"/>
were ſurpriz'd to behold at one end of the Meadows, as it were, an Epitome of the Reſurrection, and of the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For three or four hundred Perſons ſuddenly roſe up from the Ground on which they had lain: They took no care to dreſs themſelves for want of Cloaths; not but that ſome ſew were meanly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with 'em, yet none had any ſenſe of ſhame. I durſt not deſcribe what I ſaw, and much leſs what they proffer'd to ſhew me, in caſe I wou'd have beſtow'd ſome ſmall Benevolence upon 'em. This was a Company, or if you pleaſe, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Bohemians,</hi> not of the Natives of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but of thoſe <hi>Bohemians</hi> by Profeſſion, that have no Trade, no Wealth, no Friends, and no Induſtry, and yet live, and that too with a ſort of liberty, that you ſhall not meet with in the moſt free Republick in the World.</p>
               <p>I was then travelling, accompany'd with a <hi>Polander,</hi> and a very learned Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Stralſund,</hi> nam'd M. <hi>Leve:</hi> They were no leſs ſurpriz'd than I, at this Apparition, and our Conference was
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42254:152"/>
not diſcontinu'd but by a little Quarrel that aroſe between 'em upon account of Religion. The <hi>Polander,</hi> who was a moſt zealous <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, recited by way of Devotion, a <hi>Te Deum,</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> made in imitation of the Hymn which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> compos'd for the Divine Service. The <hi>Lutheran</hi> cou'd not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear it; neither cou'd he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear telling him, that his Prayer was ſuperſtitious and impious; and, that, by preſuming to attribute to Men ſuch Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as were peculiar to the ſupreme Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Almighty God was entirely depriv'd of thoſe that were due to him alone. I had much adoe to put an end to this Altercation, and effected it only by oppoſing that Article of the general Treaty of Peace, which Prohibits all ſorts of Perſons to diſturb the Publick Tranquillity under any pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whatſoever.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Vienna</hi> I had once more the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to do Reverence to His Imperial Majeſty, and thoſe Moments, during
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42254:152"/>
which he was graciouſly pleas'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me into his Preſence, finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd my Perſwaſion, that he is the moſt accompliſh'd Prince that ever was, and even ever ſhall be in the World: He was ſtanding upon a kind of Alcove: when he condeſcended ſo far as to call me to him, where what he thought fit to tell me, and the manner of expreſſing himſelf, affected my Heart more than my Ears. Indeed I had hitherto only offer'd it to God, but then I judg'd it not to be unreaſonable to make a Preſent of it alſo to him, who repreſents the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty upon Earth. The Poets have not given ſo ſublime a Character of their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as that which I obſerv'd in the Perſon of this moſt Auguſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: Inſomuch that the moſt Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Eloquence wou'd fail, if it ſhou'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to expreſs my Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; and much more my mean Epiſtolary Style. However, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear declaring, that if Fortune ſhou'd one day favour my moderate Abilities, I ſhall leave no means unattempted to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42254:153"/>
demonſtrate my grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that kind Reception, and of thoſe many ſignal Bounties with which his Imperial Majeſty has thought fit to Honour me. I took another opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to viſit his admirable Treaſures, but more eſpecially thoſe of the Books and Medals. I there ſaw that infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of choice Manuſcripts in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and upon all ſorts of Subjects, as well Ancient as Modern, without which (as I take it) 'tis impoſſible to attain to an exact Style; and at the ſame time I turn'd over thoſe incomparable Draughts of <hi>J. Strada,</hi> which a Man cannot peruſe without becoming both more Judicious and more Learned. <hi>M. Lambecius,</hi> who has 'em in his Cuſtody, in quality of Library-Keeper, ſhew'd me all poſſible demonſtrations of Kindneſs: His Name is well known, and highly honour'd by all thoſe that are addicted to the Study of the moſt ſublime Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; but the Five Volumes which he has lately publiſh'd, ſeem to add a new luſtre to his Reputation. His admirable
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42254:153"/>
Book which bears the Title of <hi>Bibliothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Caeſarea,</hi> contains an Account of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is exquiſite, curious, and rare in the Emperour's Library. I have perus'd thoſe Five Volumes at <hi>Vienna;</hi> and altho' I had but a ſmall ſpace of time to ſpend in that Imployment, yet they appear'd to me to be too ſhort, which is undoubtedly a good ſign (my Lord) as 'tis a very bad one, when a Man is tir'd with reading a little Book. Indeed I never ſet Foot in this Library without diſcovering ſome new Lights and improving my Knowledge to a higher degree; ſo eaſie a Matter it is to become Learned, by having recourſe to ſo inexhauſtible a Store-Houſe of good Literature. The moſt part of Matters are there to be found already digeſted, and with never ſo little Judgment one may eaſily diſcern what is certainly true from what has only ſome appearance of Truth, and by conſequence argue rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally upon any Subject whatſoever. I reſided there about three Months, and cou'd even have ſpent my whole Life in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42254:154"/>
theſe Studies, without the leaſt fatigue or wearineſs.</p>
               <p>There were no longer any <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſeen at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which was the cauſe that I wanted many Medals: They had been expell'd thence about a Year before, and out of the whole Country of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Indeed Complaints are every where made of 'em; and the Tributes which they pay to Princes for their Protection are not very efficacious to mollifie the Hatred which they have deſervedly incurr'd: They are the moſt cruel Enemies of the Chriſtians, as if they were authoriz'd by the Old Teſtament to commit thoſe Robberies, Maſſacres, and Poyſonings of which they are ſo often Convicted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that believe the New. A Phyſician may well compare 'em to the Spleen, whoſe uſe is of no great Importance; in regard that 'tis often ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Body, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Animal Functions: It impairs the Soundneſs of the other Parts, by appropriating to it ſelf the Humours which ought to ſerve for their Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42254:154"/>
and in a word, cauſes 'em to pine away, and to periſh thro' empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if it be not timely prevented from growing too big. The <hi>Jews</hi> wou'd do the like to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if it were in their Power; for they ſubſiſt only by Artifice and Fraud. I have obſerv'd, that the common People are not ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably Poor in any Countries as in thoſe where the <hi>Jews</hi> are tolerated; ſo that it may be avouch'd, that they conſume their Subſtance. Beſides, they are good for nothing; they are not ſo Judicious as they were in times paſt, neither can they endure to apply themſelves to any ſort of Work or Labour; ſo that Sloath and Ignorance will at laſt involve them in all manner of Calamities. The little Town which they formerly Inhabited, at preſent bears the Name of <hi>Leopolſtadt,</hi> and ſerves as it were a Suburbs to <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which is ſeparated from it only by a ſmall Arm of the <hi>Danube.</hi> It is very neatly built, and the Churches are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd, after having defac'd even the leaſt Marks of their Superſtition; a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42254:155"/>
of which will be ſeen for a long time in the Painting of the high Altar, where the Emperour and Empreſs ſeem to offer up all their Regalities to God, imploring his Protection for the ſafety of their little Imperial Princeſs and of their People. In another Painting of the ſame Church is repreſented a Young Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Infant ſtabb'd to Death with Pen-knives by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Colour of Religion receive the Blood in a Baſon to be afterward us'd in their abominable Myſteries. It is not without reaſon that the Religion of the <hi>Turks</hi> is call'd that of Swine: and it may be alſo juſtly affirm'd, that the Religion of the <hi>Jews</hi> is that of ſuperſtitious Bigots; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, without prophaning that Word, which is in a manner Sacred, and ought only to be apply'd to ſignifie the Worſhip which we owe to the true God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> put me in mind of a flight Embaſſy which I ſaw at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where they reſided about two Months. After having had a Publick Audience of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42254:155"/>
Vice-Preſident of the Council of War, they demanded one alſo of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himſelf, and had much ado to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, by reaſon of the little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Affairs about which they came to treat; yet the good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which is held between the two Empires at laſt caus'd it to be granted. It was joyful News to me to be inform'd that the <hi>Turks</hi> avoided even the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that might give any offence to his Imperial Majeſty, and that by that means the Rebels in <hi>Hungary</hi> cou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no Supplies, but wou'd be ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to ſubmit to his Clemency. Theſe Ambaſſadors were lodg'd without the City, and guarded after the ſame manner with which thoſe Chriſtian No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men are uſually treated who are ſent on an Embaſſy to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repair'd to their Appartment, and yet cou'd never get an opportunity to ſee 'em at their Meals, altho' I was very deſirous of the Sight; I was only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter their Stables, where I ſaw very fine Horſes, which they had
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42254:156"/>
tranſported on purpoſe to Trade with 'em: For theſe <hi>Turks</hi> (my Lord) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Babarity, are very Covetous, and leave no Stone unturn'd to get Money. I brought along with me out of that Country a rich Horſe-Cloath Embroider'd in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where (as they ſay) is the fineſt Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of this kind: Indeed 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly beautiful without comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gold and Silver which are wrought in it, even to the thickneſs of two Fingers. I cou'd wiſh that it were ſufficiently curious to give content to your Highneſs, and that it were worth your acceptance.</p>
               <p>It is well known that the <hi>Turks</hi> have an averſion to all manner of Games and Sports; or to expreſs it better, they know not what 'tis to Game or Play; inſomuch that Tennis-Play and Bowling ſeem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ridiculous in their Apprehenſion. <hi>Theſe ſottiſh Chriſtians</hi> (ſay they) <hi>throw a Ball into the Air, run after it, purſue it, and run back again: If they are ſo enamour'd with it, why do they not take
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42254:156"/>
it? Why do they not keep it? Why do they take ſo much pains for a Ball that cannot ſtir of it ſelf?</hi> They abhor all ſorts of Games at Cards and Dice, but they have another kind of Sport. I have often ſeen 'em hurling Faggot-ſticks and ſmall Billets at one anothers Heads; the chief Dexterity of the Thrower is to ſtrike his Antagoniſt as hard as he can; whilſt the other not only endeavours to avoid the Blow (as I ſhou'd be apt to do in the like caſe) but alſo goes to meet it and catches it with his Hand, as if it were neither heavy nor hard, in order to throw it back immediately, with the like deſign of offending the former. You may eaſily imagine, that they do not often leave off without ſpilling of Blood, yet they are as much good Friends as ever, and he that does the moſt miſchief paſſes among 'em for the moſt gallant Man.</p>
               <p>I ſaw ſome other Sports or rather Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in which the <hi>Germans</hi> (in my Opinion) take delight, as it were to keep up their ancient Cuſtoms. Much
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42254:157"/>
Agility of Body and dexterity are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for the performing of this Exerciſe; but both theſe Qualities wou'd not produce any conſiderable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, unleſs accompany'd with a great deal of ſtrength. The two-handed Sword, the Spear, the Halberd, and the <hi>Toſeck</hi> are their principal Inſtruments. Altho' theſe People ſeem ſtill to retain ſomewhat of that ancient fierceneſs, with which their Anceſtors were tax'd, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they are far from being ſo cruel, as the Cudgel-Players whom I ſaw in the publick places of the City of <hi>London,</hi> where a Man's Head is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably broken by way of Divertiſement: The Inhabitants of <hi>Vienna</hi> are wont to do it only in the preſence of an Officer, who takes care to regulate the Fight, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes his Authority to ſeparate the Cambatants, whenſoever he ſuſpects that they may be tranſported with Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, Jealouſie, or over-much Paſſion; not but that I have often ſeen the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Blood in thoſe Rencounters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:42254:157"/>Altho' theſe Sights were irkſome to me, yet they had not that effect upon my Mind as the fury of the brute Beaſts, eſpecially when the Maſtive Dogs were let looſe upon a Bull, and new ones were ſet on to relieve the others that were Wounded, or tir'd with the Fight. I alſo ſaw others engag'd with Bears, Wolves, and Dogs. The outragious fierceneſs of theſe Animals puts me in mind of the delight they afforded to the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who were wont to conferr the Conſular and Sacerdotal Dignities upon thoſe Perſons from whoſe Liberality they expected the moſt magnificent publick Shews, and the moſt extraordinary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements of this Nature. <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was very ſenſible of it; and altho' he was endu'd with undaunted Courage, Magnanimity, Prudence, and all thoſe excellent Qualities which are neceſſary for the keeping of ſo potent a State in ſubjection; nevertheleſs he did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to make uſe of theſe little Artifices; nay, it has been obſerv'd, that he brought his Family to very great Exigencies; or
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42254:158"/>
to ſpeak more properly, ruin'd himſelf to get the Good-will of the People, by the multitude and grandeur of the Shews with which he dazzl'd their Eyes. Upon the whole Matter 'tis evident, that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> is a delightful City, if there be any in the World; and as I make no difficulty to affirm, that unleſs a Man were born in <hi>France,</hi> it were to be wiſh'd, that he were a Native of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo averr, That if one cannot find means to ſpend his Life at <hi>Paris,</hi> 'tis moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to do it at <hi>Vienna.</hi> From <hi>Vienna</hi> I paſs'd to</p>

But that which (in my Mind) augments the Beauty of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42254:158"/>
Place is that vaſt maſs of Rocks, which is as it were cut perpendicularly, and ſeems to threaten the City with Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Indeed we there beheld the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Ruines of a Monaſtery, and ſome Houſes which were, as it were, bury'd ſome Months before under a heap of Rocks. Certain Work-men who were employ'd on the top in cutting the Rock perfectly ſteep, ſeem'd to us to be no bigger than Ants; and to ſay thus much may be ſufficient (as I take it) to expreſs its height. The fineſt Church-Yard or Burying-place that ever I ſaw, is that of St. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> which is rather a Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of curious Paintings to delight the Eyes and Mind than the diſmal Pomp of a Funeral Shew. The Inhabitants of this Country are ambitious to cauſe their Memory to be honour'd after their Death, or rather (as I am apt to believe) theſe Honours are paid to the Deceaſed, for the Conſolation of the Living. The ſtately Chappel which ſtands in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of four Galleries, was built to ſerve as a Tomb to an Arch-Biſhop. Indeed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42254:159"/>
all theſe People from the higheſt Station to the loweſt ſeem to take delight in this kind of Magnificence; much after the ſame manner as it happen'd in <hi>Aegypt</hi> three or four Thouſand Years ago, where the Indigent had their Pyramids as well as the Kings, neither were the ſeveral conditions of Men otherwiſe diſtinguiſh'd than by the difference of the Expences: Such is the Vanity of degenerate Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which nevertheleſs will be at laſt as it were annihilated, and lie hid under a few Foot of Earth, where will be no longer any diſtinction between the Rich and the Poor; nor will <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great take up more ſpace than the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <hi>Irus.</hi>

thoſe that come near it to fall, even to their utter diſappointment. My Father, whoſe Memory is moſt precious to me, was wont to ſay, that it was the Ape of the <hi>Galenical</hi> Art, and the adulterated Coin of our Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Salizburg</hi> is a ſomewhat ſurprizing Structure, and is juſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd (as it ought to be) one of the Bulwarks of Chriſtendom, as being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of putting a ſtop to the Incurſions of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in caſe by misfortune they ſhou'd ever penetrate ſo far. The Arch-Biſhop was ſo obliging to me and my Company, as to give Orders that it ſhou'd be ſhewn to us; and I ſaw the place of his Reſidence, the ſtatelineſs of which is conformable to the Account of it I had before receiv'd; as to its Ornaments, Beauty, number of Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis not inferiour to any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in the World. However, I ſhall leave the deſcription of it to others, in regard I am accuſtom'd only to behold ſuch ſorts of Objects with admiration and complacency,; my chief delight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

converſant about Hiſtorical Rarities, but except ſome few Statues that were ſet there for State and Magnificence ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than out of Curioſity, I cou'd not find any thing of that nature. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that which encreas'd my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that the Prince, the preſent Arch-Biſhop is a very Learned and Eloquent Perſon, endu'd alſo with a profound Judgment; as I plainly perceiv'd in the Conference with which he was pleas'd to Honour me. In acquainting me that he had no ancient Medals, he expreſs'd the eſteem that he had for 'em, and ſhew'd me at the ſame time, ſeveral Books that were writ by me on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and which he had ſent for out of his Library. It wou'd be a kind of good Fortune to Curioſity, if ſo ſublime a <hi>Genius,</hi> and ſo Noble a Lord as this Arch-biſhop wou'd vouchſafe to ſet apart ſome time for theſe Studies; nay, I durſt even preſume to affirm, that His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wou'd reap no ſmall advantage from ſuch a diſpoſition of Mind. How great are the Cares of Government, and with
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42254:162"/>
how many weariſome Hours is it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded! You are not ignorant of it (my Lord) <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great endur'd theſe fatigues; and <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was not exempted from 'em; ſo that Your moſt ſerene Highneſs and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Saltzburg</hi> are only free from ſuch anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſtractions: A Cabinet of Medals; a little application to the viewing of ſo many Hero's which they repreſent; a word of Commendation for the Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes; a grain of Salt let fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tyrants; and admiration for all, might ſerve (in my Opinion) as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative for a ſublime Mind, too much taken up and tir'd with the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſecular Affairs. This wou'd be the moſt delectable <hi>Nepenthes,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, at leaſt to my Palate. Shall I take the liberty to declare to Your Highneſs what is a farther cauſe of my admiration in this reſpect? It is upon account that thoſe Perſons who ſeem to be beſt able to bear the charge that is neceſſary for the making of ſuch Collections, are leaſt of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42254:162"/>
to do it. The Eccleſiaſtical Princes with whom I convers'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> are not much addicted to Curioſity, at leaſt to that of Medals. I met with nothing remarkable at <hi>Mentz,</hi> altho' the Elector lately Deceas'd, was endu'd with all the excellent Qualities that can be imagin'd; but perhaps he was not acquainted with theſe kinds of Delights. The Grand Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, at preſent Vice-Roy of <hi>Hungary,</hi> is Magnificent in every thing; for 'tis apparent from the vaſt Expences which he lays out in furniſhing his Table, in Hunting, and other noble Divertiſements, that 'tis not the effect of Frugality that he has no Medals, and yet he is not ſupply'd with any. He told me himſelf at <hi>Mergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theim,</hi> where I went on purpoſe to wait upon His Highneſs, that if thoſe Princes cou'd be perſwaded to ſet a-part a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or two hundred Piſtoles for that uſe (which is a very inconſiderable Summ with reſpect to their Revenues) beſides the benefit which they themſelves might reap from thence, it would turn very
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42254:163"/>
much to the advantage of Poſterity, and the Republick of Learning. By this means their Cabinets wou'd be daily enrich'd with new Supplies, and many rare Pieces wou'd be eaſily preſerv'd, which are often melted down by the Goldſmiths for want of Buyers, witneſs that half of a Golden Medal which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in our Poſſeſſion with the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of <hi>Peſcennius Niger.</hi> Thoſe Princes that delight in ſuch Curioſities wou'd take a very good courſe (in my Mind) to enjoyn the Goldſmiths in their reſpective Dominions, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Magiſtrates of every Town of all the occaſions they ſhall have both of buying and ſelling Medals of Gold, Silver, and Copper. Beſides, that by that means all opportunities of ſtealing 'em might be taken away, it wou'd tend very much to the Princes advantage, without doing Injury to any Perſon whatever. The Goldſmiths uſually buy 'em by weighr, according to the value of the Metal, and for a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that might be allow'd to theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42254:163"/>
they wou'd be engag'd to melt none down. It is true indeed, that for a greater precaution it wou'd be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to impoſe a Fine upon thoſe that ſhou'd preſume to act contrary to the Royal Mandate, in melting down any without a Licence, or that ſhou'd neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to give timely notice of it to the Magiſtrate, or ſome other Perſon au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd by the Prince to exerciſe that Imployment in every City or Town. This Order (in my Opinion) wou'd take great effect in the principal Towns, eſpecially thoſe that are ſituated upon a Road or publick Highway. Therefore it were to be wiſh'd, that the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Saltzburg</hi> were inform'd of this Project, and that he wou'd vouchſafe to put it in execution; neither do I doubt but that in proceſs of time it wou'd evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that I have no leſs zeal for his Service than affection and reſpect for his Perſon.</p>
               <p>After having ſpent eight Days at <hi>Saltzburg,</hi> I determin'd to ſet forward from thence to <hi>Tirol,</hi> but in the middle
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42254:164"/>
of the <hi>Alps</hi> two Soldiers ſhew'd me an Order they had receiv'd to prohibit all manner of Paſſengers from entring that Country, without obtaining a Paſs from the Emperour. However, my Equipage gave 'em no occaſion of ſuſpicion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that I rode Poſt in a Chariot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd only with a Friend on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; but perhaps the Character of my Nation made 'em ſtand it out more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately, and the reſpect that I ow'd to their Maſter oblig'd me to return. I had a fair Plea, that I was juſt now come from <hi>Vienna,</hi> where His Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty treated me with all manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of his Princely Favour, yet nothing was able to divert 'em from their Reſolution. <hi>Polybius</hi> wou'd never have imagin'd a <hi>French</hi>-man to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with ſo much moderation; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he was ſometimes miſtaken, when he declar'd, <hi>Galli non dicam in pleriſque, ſed prorſus in omnibus actionibus ſuis; irâ atque impetu, non conſilio reguntur. The</hi> French-<hi>men, I will not ſay for the moſt part, but even altogether in all their
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42254:164"/>
Actions are tranſported with Heat and Paſſion, and never obſerve the Rules of Moderation.</hi> Thus I was conſtrain'd to return to <hi>Saltzburg,</hi> where the Arch-Biſhop did not think fit to grant me a Paſs thro' the Emperour's Territories; inſomuch that I was much troubl'd how to get back to <hi>Vienna</hi> to procure one; but I choſe rather to go to <hi>Munick,</hi> where having obtain'd a Licence, I enter'd the moſt delightful Plains of <hi>Tirol.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Inſpruck</hi> ſeem'd to me as it were a rich Diamond ſet within its Ring; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Luſtre appearing every where, and that tranſcendent Splendor which affects the Mind rather than the Eyes; altho' I happen'd to be there at the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival of <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> during which the fervent heat of Devotion is a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary defenſative againſt the coldneſs of the Seaſon: There I ſaw that Arch-Dutcheſs, who (as they ſay) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be given in Marriage to His Royal Highneſs of <hi>England.</hi> Indeed ſo great a degree of Beauty, Gracefulneſs, and Majeſty, cannot well be imagin'd;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42254:165"/>
inſomuch that <hi>Zeuxis</hi>'s <hi>Venus,</hi> which was the Maſter-piece of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Painter in the World, was not ſet off to greater advantage; nevertheleſs, that Painting was the Epitome, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exact Copy of the moſt exquiſite Beauties among the <hi>Graecian</hi> Dames, who were reputed (as Your Highneſs is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) to be the faireſt in the World. What I have been told concerning the rare Endowments of her Mind, ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes every thing that I have ſeen; but I ſhall not detain your Patience ſo long as to expreſs the <hi>Idea</hi> which ought to be form'd of it. Whilſt I was writing theſe particulars, News was brought me of the Death of the Empreſs; ſo that if it were not too audacious a preſumption to propoſe a Match for the Emperour, I ſhou'd be induc'd to nominate this Princeſs: All their Qualities (in my Mind) are conformable, and who knows whether this may not actually come to paſs, ſince 'tis not the firſt time that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination has been ſeconded with a ſuitable event; <hi>Imaginatio generat caſum,</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:42254:165"/>
according to the common Saying of Phyſicians; as for my part, I ſhou'd be extreamly delighted if it ſhou'd ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as well with reſpect to the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of His Imperial Majeſty, as for the benefit of the Empire. I hope your moſt Serene Highneſs will not take it ill that I preſume ſo far as to add a Word or two in commendation of the deceas'd Empreſs; I have had the Honour to ſee her both in the Church and at the Court, and have every where obſerv'd her to be a moſt vertuous Princeſs; ſo that Malice it ſelf wou'd grow pale for want of ſufficient Matter to raiſe a Calumny againſt her Perſon. The Emperour had the greateſt Affection and Reſpect for her imaginable: But I have been told, that the ill Treatment of the Proteſtants in <hi>Hungary</hi> was the effect of the Zeal of this Princeſs, and of the Advice of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to which His Imperial Majeſty had much deference upon her Account. The ſtate of her Health was never very vigorous; the tenderneſs, or (to ſpeak more like a Phyſician) the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42254:166"/>
weakneſs of her Conſtitution being no leſs than that of her Body: Indeed the later was capable of being ſtrengthen'd by proper Remedies, and a good Diet, which were not wanting; but I durſt even affirm, that ſhe ſometimes us'd too much with reſpect to her natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament and Strength, which was not able to digeſt ſo great a quantity. For 'tis neceſſary in this caſe to obſerve a kind of Geometrical proportion, <hi>&amp; ad vires,</hi> (as 'tis expreſs'd in our Phyſical Treatiſes) and the moſt part of the World is deceiv'd upon this very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>In Travelling from <hi>Tirol</hi> I ſpent five or ſix Days on the <hi>Alps</hi> in the midſt of Winter, and yet without feeling any Cold; for every thing was cover'd with Snow except the Road, which was as dear and verdant as in the Spring-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There I ſaw the Paſſage which the <hi>Swedes</hi> endeavour'd to make during the laſt Wars, but were not able to bring it to effect: However, King <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Every one talks of the Strength and Valour of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> but they are

not ſufficiently known to the World; neither is it poſſible for any Man to get a clear inſight into their Conſtitutions, if without making any Reflections on their paſt Hiſtory, he applies himſelf only to the conſideration of their preſent State. The Art of War and thoſe Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which are termed Liberal flouriſh in thoſe Parts at the ſame time; but ſince their luſtre has been eclips'd during many Ages, it wou'd be requiſite to ſearch out their Original even before the time that the barbarous Nations over-ran, as it were an univerſal Deluge, the faireſt Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> For <hi>Switzerland</hi> being contiguous to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was ſoon involv'd in theſe common Calamities, and it may be juſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that it has ſound means to free it ſelf from 'em only by vertue of its own Strength and Energy.

The Statue of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who was the Founder of the great Church, is ſtill to be ſeen on one of its Towers, with a Crown upon his Head, and a Sword in his Hand; and I take this Monument to be very remarkable. The Canton of <hi>Zurich,</hi> (as you well know my Lord) holds the firſt Rank among thoſe of <hi>Switzerland;</hi> being very potent upon account of its

Populouſneſs, Riches, and Extent: But I ſhall leave the particular deſcription of it to Hiſtorians, in regard that my preſent Deſign is only to take notice of Matters relating to Antiquity or Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</p>
               <p>Will your moſt Serene Highneſs vouchſafe to give me leave to relate two pleaſant Stories, which may ſerve to give ſome Indication of the Manners of theſe People? Two <hi>Burgundians</hi> went on a certain time to buy Horſes at <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich,</hi> where in diſcourſing with their Land-lord they gave it out that as the <hi>French</hi> had already made themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Franche Comtè,</hi> they might perhaps arrive very ſuddenly in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> and that they wou'd at leaſt oblige the Inhabitants to tie and untie their Shoes: In the mean while, a Neighbour being inform'd by the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper of the Diſcourſe that happen'd between theſe Foreigners, went to meet 'em with a Sword by his ſide, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of 'em whether that which was reported to him were true: Whereupon
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42254:173"/>
theſe poor Wretches were extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, yet cou'd not deny what they had ſo openly declar'd: <hi>Come hither</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Switzer</hi> to one of 'em) <hi>and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie this Shoe for me</hi> which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done: <hi>Then</hi> (continu'd he) <hi>go forward and bring thy Companion before me:</hi> As ſoon as the other drew near, he was in like manner oblig'd to ſubmit, and to tie the ſame Shoe again. <hi>Learn then</hi> (reply'd the <hi>Switzer</hi> to both) <hi>that our Country-men are only induc'd to ſerve by Friendſhip, and that they'll cauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be obey'd whenever they are threaten'd.</hi> The other Story is much of the ſame Nature. A <hi>German</hi> paſſing thro' a Village of the Canton of <hi>Zurich,</hi> demanded which was the Road, of a young Peaſant, whom he call'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his uſual manner of drolling <hi>Kyemelker;</hi> the latter ſet him in the right way, and immediately ran to his Father to acquaint him with the Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name which had been impos'd on him by the Traveller. The good Old-Man had no ſooner heard it, but he engages
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42254:173"/>
two of his Friends to accompany him, overtakes the <hi>German,</hi> and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd him to alight from his Horſe, compell'd him to Milk a Cow for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time in ſpite of his Teeth. <hi>Get thee gone then</hi> (ſaid he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) <hi>and boaſt if thou ſhalt think fit, that thou haſt been in the Country of</hi> Keyemelkers, <hi>and that thou haſt been no leſs a partaker of the ſame Employment than they.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may be ſufficient (my Lord) to ſhew the <hi>Genius</hi> or natural Diſpoſition of the Nation, and I have even found an ancient Inſcription, <hi>GENIO PAG. TIGOR.</hi> If I durſt deſcribe it by any other Character than that of Liberty, I ſhou'd undoubtedly mention the Zeal that they have for their Religion. The Divines have great Power and Authority among 'em, and even ſometimes oblige the Magiſtrates to a more than ordinary ſeverity.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the continual noiſe of the Drums, yet the Muſes do not ceaſe to have their <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> in this

I have been ſhewn the place in the River where the Ingenious M. <hi>Hottinger</hi> was unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately drown'd with part of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: He was that famous Profeſſor of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue whom the States of <hi>Holland</hi> ſent for to adorn their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Leyden.</hi> I am alſo oblig'd to the Courteſie of his Sons for the ſight of ſome Oriental Medals that remain in their poſſeſſion. The publick Library is as it were a Nurſery for Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as containing all ſorts of Books, and very conſiderable Manuſcripts. There are likewiſe divers Medals, and ſome very rare ones: They have been much eſteem'd as ſoon as their uſe was known, and 'tis probable that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will be encreas'd from time to time, till at laſt a very fine Cabinet be made
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42254:174"/>
of 'em. As for my part; I view'd 'em with great delight, and was even ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the ſatisfaction which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me. I ſhall not here make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Careſſes or Complements which are every where Cuſtomary, but the Senate was pleas'd to ſhew their good Will toward me with much more ſolid Marks, which I ſhall always keep in Mind, even during my whole Life.</p>
               <p>One cannot Travel very far in that Country without diſcovering ſome rare Monuments of Antiquity; and indeed, I find many of 'em mention'd by Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but I cou'd wiſh they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd after another manner; for Books are now ſubject to a much more critical Cenſure than formerly. Therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may give encouragement to one of my Friends to undertake the Work, whoſe Abilities (I can aſſure you) are ſufficient for the performing it with good Succeſs. However, I ſhall here obſerve before-hand, ſome of thoſe Curioſities that have affected my Mind more than the others. I took delight in viewing

the Caſtle of <hi>Bipp,</hi> which (as 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) was built by the Order of King <hi>Pepin</hi> for the convenience of Hunting. There are Bears in thoſe Parts, my Lord, and at that time the uſe of Muſquets and Fowling-pieces was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. The People were then appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently more reſolute and deſperate in their Enterprizes than at preſent, at leaſt they were much more Couragious than I am.</p>

I obſerv'd the Stirrups that belong to it; but were any worn at that time, my Lord? I am perſwaded that your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being ſo judicious, wou'd anſwer in the Negative; if you ſhou'd think fit to make me any reply: <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſubject to a certain Diſeaſe for want of making a ſtay for their Feet when they rode on Horſeback; and Stirrups are undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a modern Invention; nay, there are ſome whole Nations that do not as yet
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42254:182"/>
make uſe of 'em. However, I ſhall have a due deference for Tradition, and ſhall not condemn thoſe Perſons who are willing to believe, that the Stirrups which are kept at <hi>Payerne,</hi> were really ſerviceable to <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>

               <p>For the Church, the College, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places, and the private Houſes are all full of 'em; nay, in the very Lake it ſelf there is a kind of Rock which is call'd <hi>La Pierre de Nijon</hi> by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and which, without doubt, was an Altar dedicated to <hi>Neptune:</hi> The Hole that remains above is apparently the place of the Idol: Divers Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, heretofore us'd in Sacrifices, are often found thereabouts; and certain Fiſher-men who div'd in this Lake ſome

What can I declare concerning <hi>Geneva,</hi> that is not already known to your moſt Serene Highneſs, who is ſo well vers'd in the knowledge of the peculiar Intereſts of States, as alſo of the Original of their various Leagues, Differences, and publick Tranſactions. This City is better ſecur'd at preſent than in the preceding Age from the Enterprizes of its Enemies, and it has reaſon more eſpecially to ground its ſafety upon the Protection of our Kings; nay, the Prudence, Equity, and Power of the great Prince who now Reigns will certainly deliver it from all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Fear. Otherwiſe, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are not unmindful of their true Intereſt; their Arſenal is always main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in a good Condition; and there they ſhew with Joy the Spoils of the

The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary is fill'd with variety of uſeful and curious Books.

               <p>The Bible is highly eſteem'd at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and I cannot better put an end to my Diſcourſe than with this Obſervation.
